This is so you can make HTML that is \"rendered\" or dynamically created on the server before a client loads it in the browser.  PHP is a server side language that also does templating and dynamically creates HTML on the server and injects data into it, modern JavaScript frame works like Next JS offer a bunch of tools and bring a front end component way of thinking to the server.  But overall they are solving the same problem of how to give a client(or any user agent) all the content they will need for the first page they request the first time so they don't have to wait(even if it's a small or an unrecognizable amount of time) for a whole bunch of JavaScript to get parsed and run.  A user will most likely need to make subsequent requests to the server or have the JavaScript update the HTML page after the first request, but this approach eases the load on the client by getting them interacting with you web page faster and allows Search Engine Optimization since web crawlers can't see/create or simply ignore content that is triggered by user interactions.  I am using it because I am familiar with JavaScript more than other server side languages like PHP and Python, and it's easy to get up and running and has the perfect amount of features to create a small to medium sized website that Next or Nuxt JS seem to be a little overkill for.  As always use the tool suited for the job and one that you are most comfortable with so you can get it done quickly and accurately.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Kudaravalli Sai", "text": "Absolutely amazing, thank you so much ;)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u0130brahim Karabulut", "text": "Awosome, thanks for this tutorial", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "AnLoMinus RhytMix", "text": "every sectioni wanted give 1 more like but cant :-)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "computerhoofd", "text": "I like your keyboard sound", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "AEE Web", "text": "can i use ejs like this ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "ArticFrostTRD", "text": "im curious, what keyboard is he using, and the switches type?", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Anabil Debnath", "text": "can anyone help me with installing pug in vs", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Atom Dellow", "text": "Hey thanks for this video, this one was a great demo of a concise intro to PUG and Node JS.
