Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. Learn how it can be utilized to manage and automate your AWS cloud infrastructure. We'll start off by setting up a free AWS account to play around with and move on to setting up and installing Terraform on a Windows/MAC/Linux machine. \n\nFrom there we'll move on to deploying our first resource through terraform and learning other core concepts. You'll even get a chance to setup a simple web server in AWS.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Sanjeev-Thiyagarajan/Terraform-Crash-Course\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Download Terraform: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 This course was developed by Sanjeev Thiyagarajan.

Por Cristo Nosso Senhor. Am\u00e9m.\n\nORIGEM DA NOVENA.\n\nEssa Novena a S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier surgiu de um fato hist\u00f3rico, acontecido em 11 de dezembro de 1633. No final de uma festa no\nPal\u00e1cio real de N\u00e1poles (It\u00e1lia), seis oper\u00e1rios estavam desmontando um altar projetado pelo padre jesu\u00edta Marcelo Mastrilli.\nUm destes oper\u00e1rios, que trabalhava numa escada muito comprida, deixou escapar um martelo que acabou atingindo a cabe\u00e7a do Pe.\nMastrilli. Socorrido e transportado ao col\u00e9gio jesu\u00edta, o religioso recebeu todas as curas poss\u00edveis dos m\u00e9dicos, mas em v\u00e3o.\nPe. Mastrilli agravou-se ao ponto que, depois de 21 dias, em 2 de janeiro de 1634, agonizava. No entanto, na manh\u00e3 de quarta-feira, 4 de janeiro, Pe. Mastrilli j\u00e1 estava no altar celebrando a Santa Missa.\n\nO que tinha acontecido?\nO pr\u00f3prio padre explica que, antes de receber a un\u00e7\u00e3o dos enfermos, tinha feito um voto diante do superior, Pe. Carlo Di Sangro, de partir como mission\u00e1rio para o Oriente caso sa\u00edsse dessa.\n\nEm seguida, pediu ao seu confessor para trazer ao quarto uma imagem de S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier. Colocando na altura da garganta uma pequena rel\u00edquia do santo, rezou para que lhe concedesse a Comunh\u00e3o antes de morrer. Com efeito, ele p\u00f4de receber a Comunh\u00e3o, rodeado pelos confrades.\n\nDepois de alguns instantes ouviu chamar: \u2013 \u201cMarcelo! Marcelo!\u201d.\nDirigindo o olhar para a imagem de S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier, viu uma pessoa vestida como um romeiro, com as apar\u00eancias do santo, que lhe disse:\n\n\u2013 \u201cPois bem, o que voc\u00ea quer fazer? Quer morrer ou partir como mission\u00e1rio para a \u00cdndia?\u201d. Pe. Mastrilli respondeu que desejava cumprir com a vontade de Deus. \u201cN\u00e3o lembra \u2013 prosseguiu, ent\u00e3o, o santo \u2013 que ontem, com a permiss\u00e3o do superior, fez o voto de ir para o Oriente, se Deus o tivesse curado?\u201d.\n\nCom a sua resposta afirmativa, o santo continuou: \u2013 \u201cPortanto, com alegria, repita comigo essas palavras\u2026\u201d\nO santo fez-lhe repetir a f\u00f3rmula dos votos religiosos, acrescentando a promessa de partir como mission\u00e1rio e o pedido do mart\u00edrio. Enfim acrescentou: \u2013 \u201cAgora sarou. Agrade\u00e7a a Deus por um dom t\u00e3o grande e, como sinal de adora\u00e7\u00e3o, beije as cinco chagas do crucifixo\u201d.\nTodos puderam constatar que Pe. Mastrilli estava completamente curado. Partiu para o Oriente e tr\u00eas anos depois, em 1637, morreu m\u00e1rtir em Nagasaki, no Jap\u00e3o. Tinha 34 anos.\nGrato pela cura obtida, conservou por S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier uma grande devo\u00e7\u00e3o, que procurou difundir entre aqueles que encontrava.\n\nMuitos testemunharam as gra\u00e7as recebidas por S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier e assim difundiu-se esta devo\u00e7\u00e3o da \u201cNovena da Gra\u00e7a\u201d.\nDisse Francisco Xavier (PROMESSA):\n\n\u201cTodos aqueles que implorarem a minha ajuda por dia durante nove dias consecutivos, a partir do 4 \u00ba ao 12\u00ba dia de mar\u00e7o, e receber dignamente os sacramentos da Penit\u00eancia e da Eucaristia em um dos nove dias, vai experimentar minha prote\u00e7\u00e3o e ter esperan\u00e7a com toda certeza para obter de Deus qualquer gra\u00e7a que pedem para o bem de suas almas e a gl\u00f3ria de Deus\u201d.\n\nSANTA TERESINHA DO MENINO JESUS E A NOVENA DA GRA\u00c7A\n\nUm epis\u00f3dio, envolvendo Santa Teresinha do Menino Jesus, refor\u00e7a a convic\u00e7\u00e3o em favor da \u201cNovena da Gra\u00e7a\u201d. A irm\u00e3 dela, Maria Lu\u00edsa, ao processo de beatifica\u00e7\u00e3o da santa carmelita, fez esta declara\u00e7\u00e3o:\n\n\u2013 \u201cA caridade fazia-lhe desejar fazer o bem tamb\u00e9m depois da sua morte.\nEsse pensamento a preocupava. Em 1896 (a santa morreu um ano depois), de 4 a 12 de mar\u00e7o, fez a novena a S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier.\nEla me disse: \u2018Pedi a gra\u00e7a de fazer o bem tamb\u00e9m depois da minha morte, e agora estou certa de t\u00ea-la obtida, porque, com essa novena, obt\u00e9m-se tudo o que se deseja\u2019\u201d. Essa ora\u00e7\u00e3o tem um significado muito profundo: a gra\u00e7a obtida por intercess\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier se \u201cpaga\u201d com o compromisso mission\u00e1rio. O dom recebido por Deus deixa de ser uma gra\u00e7a para si e se torna, por sua vez, um dom para os outros e para o mundo.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxsJvT6W1YBdmWPO2N4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-21T11:43:01Z", "author": "Shailesh Kumar", "text": "this is exactly what i needed , thanks buddy .
