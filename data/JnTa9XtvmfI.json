Which means this system is a transformation of the 3D space into a 1D line that exists in the 3D space and points in the direction of the basis vector. Basically it squashes the 3D space into a line. \n\nSo can we think of the plane created by the solution set as \"scanning\" the 3D space as the particular vector changes? The particular vector will change if we leave the left side (representing the matrix) of the equation alone, and only change the numbers on the right side (representing a vector after transformation), not all numbers (vectors) will be valid in this case, as many will be outside the span of the matrix, but there are infinitely many that are within the span and are valid.\n\nSO. Each and every single vector within the span of this matrix (the line cutting through 3D space) has an entire infinite plane of vectors that were all \"squashed\" down or mapped into it. And the particular solution simply leads you to this plane of vectors... so you can imagine all of the 3D space as infinitely many planes that were all transformed/squished into the infinitely many vectors of this line..\n\nI'm trying to connect this to what I learned from the 2b1b series. Is any of what I said correct??", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bojack Horseman", "text": "\u2698\u2698\u2698\u2698\u2698", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Player Music\u266a", "text": "why don't have traslate ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Justin Berdell", "text": "Hi, hi, hi", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ic3creaM", "text": "1:18:33", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Ic3creaM", "text": "2:00:00", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Aria A", "text": "Thank you!

At least that is something valuable to get from the video). Teaching systems of linear equations without understanding matrices as transformations, knowing its properties (and properties of its kernel and image, hopefully the English vocabulary includes these two terms as well), the determinant, decomposition of a vector into linear combination of bases etc. feels straight stupid. I have watched the first hour and this problem is poinfully obvious, because many results (e.g. that the solution is composed of homogeneous and particular part or the definition of singular matrix which is straight stupid) and methods are presented without reasonable explanation, why.\nWithout this deeper understanding, the lecture is more like better high school math, not college level.\nJust as a background, I do not study pure mathematics; I'm aiming for bachelor's degree in cybernetics at CTU in Prague.
