You can view that memory address directly if you care to. There is no set size to the memory location. OTOH, char foo[10] will allocate a chunk of memory for use with foo. You don't particularly care or know where this memory is located as long as you can use it. \nWhen allocated within a particular block of code, its \"scope\" is limited to that block. You may declare another sting inside another block with exactly the same name without affecting the original foo[10] unless you originally made it global. \nIf you use char *foo, you return an address. You may manipulate the memory directly and globally, including each element of the array by adding integer values to the memory location in accordance with the byte size of the data type. This can be a powerful tool or a dangerous one since there is no protection from foolish mistakes.
