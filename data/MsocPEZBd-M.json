In the calculator program you said that the \"nth()\" iterator will move to the next after returning the current one. Which means that it consumes the current one. Next time when you call nth(), you will end up accessing the next element. So we accessed the nth element like this \n\nargs.nth(1).unwrap(); \nargs.nth(0).unwrap(); \nargs.nth(0).unwrap(); \n\nIn the second implementation we just access the element using the function \n\nfn get_nth_arg(n: usize) -> String  {\r\n    std::env::args().nth(n).unwrap()\r\n}\n\nand called this function like \n\nimpl Args {\r\n    pub fn new() -> Self \r\n    {\r\n        Args{\r\n            image_1: get_nth_arg(1),\r\n            image_2: get_nth_arg(2),\r\n            output: get_nth_arg(3)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n }\n\nHow does the second case work and the first does not?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Shaun Hamilton", "text": "Hello there,\r\nRelevant question.
