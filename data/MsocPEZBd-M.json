So we accessed the nth element like this \n\nargs.nth(1).unwrap(); \nargs.nth(0).unwrap(); \nargs.nth(0).unwrap(); \n\nIn the second implementation we just access the element using the function \n\nfn get_nth_arg(n: usize) -> String  {\r\n    std::env::args().nth(n).unwrap()\r\n}\n\nand called this function like \n\nimpl Args {\r\n    pub fn new() -> Self \r\n    {\r\n        Args{\r\n            image_1: get_nth_arg(1),\r\n            image_2: get_nth_arg(2),\r\n            output: get_nth_arg(3)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n }\n\nHow does the second case work and the first does not?", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwqJUaoNGX-HZ3z5_d4AaABAg.9gbOXmwEfJu9gj0711KGHV", "publishedAt": "2022-10-03T16:13:55Z", "author": "Shaun Hamilton", "text": "Hello there,\r\nRelevant question.
