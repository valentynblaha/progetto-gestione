It feels like the udemy course was taken (made by the same author), sliced at some chapters.\n\nthis is not an advanced course. Basic stuff like smart pointers were not covered. Exception handling was not properly covered. Bit wise operators and bit level operations were not even touched. Vectors were not covered. So by watching and knowing everything here, you still would be a beginner. Template functions were covered but no template classes. Threading was not covered. This is not an advanced course. probably 30-40% of c++. Other STL stuff was not covered. CMake should have its own chapter. Its not really C++, but any advanced C++ programmer should know how to use cmake.\n\n\nhe did not explain what constant functions are but just began using them. He did not teach us operator overloading but used overloaded << operator methods, just to name a few. You have to google these stuff yourself and learn it from other sources.\n\nOverall a 7/10 tutorial. a 4/10 if you are really thinking this would make you an advanced c++ dev. but again, the word \"advanced\" is vague and can be different for a person. This is very nice and abridged and quickly sets anyone up to make stuff using C++.

After that, take one full day or more to do each chapter because then is where things start to get harder. \n\n\nIts ok to feel overwhelmed and stuck at some points, but if you give up really easily without trying to continue, sorry but I wouldn't recommend C++ to you. You've gotta put in the effort to learn. You don't learn huge things in a day. Your journey may last for a long time spanning a year or more.

conversion give consistently the same garbage numbers? eg 192400023 > 192400016\n\n6:24:56 Just want to point out that setting bases for negative numbers doesn't actually work.\n\n7:45:36 Ternary Operators are really cool. \ud83d\ude0e\n\n9:26:00 Why do we use \"auto\" as type declaration in the for loop? Is it because the type of i is dependent on the type of what the array is?\n\n10:19:00 Just wondering when using pointers on char is ever useful? Like it seems so dangerous and also unusable. Is it better than declaring a character array?\n> Follow up: Can you also not change the address of a pointer with const char? Is the only way to declare a character pointer like - const char * message{\" \"};   ?\n> It gives me errors like \"a value of type \"char (*)[9]\" cannot be used to initialise an entity of type \"char *\".\n\n11:23:53 Was about to say making p_number8 = nullptr; didn't work. Then I had another look and it turns out I used ==. \ud83d\ude05\n\n13:12:23 Just a note: LHS RHS usually refers to \"left hand side\" \"right hand side\".\n\n13:39:30 Ok sure, the mistake is clear. So the reason not to just have str = std::strchr(str,target) is to avoid overwriting the original pointer?  If you don't care about doing that, what's the problem??\n\n14:16:44 It seems as if we've skipped ahead. Do we have to declare the function as a variable before writing the definition or was this just proving a point?\n> Explained at 15:01:50 \ud83d\udc4d\n\n16:08:03 This idea seems to keep cropping up, it seems as if references are always more preferred to pointers since they effectively have the same function. Why is this (is it to do with memory management?) and what are some specific use cases where you'd want to use pointers over references, or where'd you'd specifically need to use either a pointer or a reference?\n\n16:48:00 Unsure about how std::string_view differs from std::string?\n\n18:08:21 Hmm don't know how to set up debugging, was not taught in this version of the course. \ud83d\ude41\n>>Update, roughly followed the instructions from the visual studio code website and created a launch.json file and added it to my template code.\n\n19:24:23 Hoping to find out why you would use any one of these concept structures over another, and also how this works with overloading. I'm sure this will get touched on. Also, is this the only usecase for concepts or do they crop up elsewhere?\n\n20:00:41 Do we need to include both portions of the concept with the nested concept? e.g. \"requres sizeof(T) <= 4\" AND \"sizeof(T) <= 4\". Or can we just have the requires by itself. Or is it like, checks first and then using that check it can satisfy the requires part??\n\n22:04:41 He's not wrong, destructors are confusing...\n> I assume we only need a destructor for when there's a pointer in our class variables?\n\n22:33:13 Really cool concept but definitely gonna have to go over this again. Why does it always get confusing when pointers are involved?\n\n23:08:42 Not super related to the current topic, but I wonder if you ever make header files just solely full of header files, and call that in the main function? If that would limit the amount of failed code because of header files being called multiple times or something like that. Or if that is never considered and not deemed an issue. Or maybe even just for neatness and organisation.\n\n25:47:14 Ok so what I find cool about this is that you can make a person object from a engineer object e.g. Person person1(eng1); I don't know how useful that is but it seems pretty neat to me.\n>Oh cool, this is more or less this slicing thing explained at 27:20:00\n\n27:47:21 Ok I don't understand. The reasoning to put \"override\" in for if you made a typo doesn't make any sense. There must be a better reason for this other than that?????? Especially since this is just more typing so more security for typos doesn't really track.\n\n28:07:55 Uhhh Daniel, Dogs aren't felines. Just saying....\n\n29:10:06 Yep this one is breaking my mind. I might have to just rewatch all of this chapter because I'm not sure I really understand static/dynamic binding. And then so setting up a base pointer to a derived class, you get the static values called? I don't really understand this at all I guess.\n>So does this still apply when you set up arrays with these elements?\n>I suppose this is why he recommends not using these. SO CONFUSING.\n>Presumably you can't get 21 with some combination of these. i.e. use default parameters from derived and method from base.\n\n30:50:45 Since an interface is an abstract class, can you have another abstract class inherit it? It wont need to override the pure virtual method will it?\n\n\nBIG THANKS TO DANIEL FOR TEACHING ME C++!!!!  Now to try some libraries. Any recommendations?

Topics include:\r\n1) Learn pointer-based memory management for heterogenous computing using Unified Shared Memory.\r\n2) Understand implicit and explicit way of moving memory using Unified Shared Memory and also handling data dependency between kernel executions.\r\n3) Understand advantages of using Subgroups in SYCL programming.\r\n4) Take advantage of Subgroup group algorithms and understand how Subgroup Shuffle operations can avoid explicit memory operations\r\n5) Use SYCL reduction to simplify reduction with parallel kernels\r\n6) Take advantages reduce function to do reduction at sub_group and work_group level\r\nWe look forward to seeing you there.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxOoDw1FG7Hai2G7ep4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-31T13:26:48Z", "author": "Sergio Santos", "text": "is it possible to use the same folder/code but compile in different systems (windows and linux)? the way i followed the course, i had to use 2 different folders to setup the task.json for windows and linux.

This whole lecture is worth 1000 hours digging into books for a person who is stranded in c++.  Almost all teachers of c++ try to skip ''why' while they're teaching c++ the first time. This is not healthy as much as I can say as a novice. A bare minimum answer to why things happening is necessary to start learning c++. Because c++ is not the language that is sitting on the well-furnished sofa. This is a language close to the machine, so hiding its ugliness by bypassing the answer to why is an extremely bad habit and terribly confusing. These are reasons which make this lecture a great among lot on Youtube Careful explanation with extensive examples and supplying the bare minimum exposition of how do machines understand. I hope people who want to start c++ will benefit a lot from this lecture. However, one more thing you can do is you can suggest some good web page or book which offers lots of exercise problems for practice in the spirit of your lecture.
