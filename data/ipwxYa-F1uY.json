I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with *WTRADE INSPECTS*, in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyam5z0tyrlFn924E54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-23T01:21:15Z", "author": "Runner 007", "text": "*WTRADE INSPECTS* ability to create good strategies that work in accordance with the market trend is something that comes easy and I am so happy I am able to take advantage of that with their  trade signals.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxSzsGJ7Wp9_ZxYbNV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-23T01:21:14Z", "author": "meme Buffoon", "text": "*WTRADE INSPECTS* is good and guaranteed, working with *WTRADE INSPECTS*  is all about win win win and truthfully day trading has so much advantages as it beats the market fluctuation", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxBfBRxoMevi3aw3Wd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-23T01:21:14Z", "author": "mrmoz gamerz Tech's 16", "text": "*WTRADE INSPECTS* has been helping alot of people recover their losses from the crash with ease, They  all we need right now.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwOQnZv2B6o-_2wfiJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-23T01:21:14Z", "author": "XYZ Guy", "text": "Got a chance to benefit from *WTRADE INSPECTS* services and it has been a very smooth experience, I went from $60k to over $400k by implementing his signals and following his guide.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxzo5om8lFiQPaFbFV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-23T01:21:12Z", "author": "Fettah Babayev", "text": "I have seen a lot of content about *WTRADE INSPECTS* and how investors were able to double their earnings,  this should create more awareness for newbies.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugza4grYFOXDYKf1H394AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-23T01:21:12Z", "author": "musicicious", "text": "Got a chance to benefit from *WTRADE INSPECTS* services a few weeks ago and it has been a very smooth experience.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwykFtMvKbHyHwczmp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-23T01:21:11Z", "author": "Mustafa Kara", "text": "Thank you *WTRADE INSPECTS* for keeping it light and real at the same time.

Point is, be patient, and just trade to build capital for when we do bottom. Don\u2019t let these institutions destroy you. And my advice, don\u2019t spread yourself thin with too many coins.

Self-host wallet btc owner whales have a hard time selling it without doing KYC and in some cases, this can wreck them financially. People lose access to their btc wallets which makes that btc frozen for all time. The Hype and FOMO is on the rise and most people only buy and hold with btc. I mean you have to understand that normal stock market fundamentals don't apply here. It's not a 2017 - 2018 scenario. The regulation added to BTC can actually even make it more desirable (although it has a minus). Basically, anything that could stop the mooning of btc imo would be extreme regulation restrictions and also better investment opportunities discovered by btc owners. However, it's best to find a working strategy/daily signals that works well in order to accumulate and grow a very strong portfolio ahead. I have been trading with Gerhard Bitcoin Strategy, his guidance makes trading less stressful and more profitable despite the recent fluctuations. I was able to easily increase my portfolio in just 2weeks of trading with Gerhard Bitcoin Strategy growing 1.5 BTC to 6.7 BTC. His daily signals are very accurate and yields a great positive return on investment and is available to give assistance to anyone who loves crypto trading, you can contact him on Telegram @ GerhardSignals.
