However, a resource was successfully created before that crash, so now we're unable to create a resource with that exact name because it was created once already.\n\nSo, if aws amplify fails to push (and you're stuck like I was), copy your version of the 2 index.js files you created for yourself, then do an \"amplify pull\" to overwrite all changes of AWS onto our local codebase. This will allow our console to recognize that the first resource was already created, and we can now paste back our 2 index.js files and successfully do \"amplify push\" when you're ready.\n\nHope this helps someone!

Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.\r\n  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.\r\n  3. Remove \"babel-eslint\" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.\r\n  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.\r\nIf this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:\r\n\r\n  5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.\r\n     This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.\r\n\r\n  6. Check if C:\\Users\\Mr_grg\\Desktop\\my-pets\\node_modules\\babel-eslint is outside your project directory.\r\n     For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.\r\n\r\n  7. Try running npm ls babel-eslint in your project folder.\r\n     This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed babel-eslint.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.\r\nThat would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.\r\n\r\nP.S.
