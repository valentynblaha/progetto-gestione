This will help your character animations to feel more lifelike when they move thier limbs to do things like walking, running, and attacking.\n\nYou will learn how to use the Open Asset Import Library (assimp) to import and export various 3d-model-formats.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Etay Meiri.
