Many people will continue using OpenGL for a long time. Regarding your comment - it depends on the OS. On Windows DirectX is the first choice but on Android you have to use OpenGL-ES which is a slim down version of OpenGL. DirectX is also not available on Linux. I actually started with OpenGL because I wanted to do 3D graphics on Linux which is my favorite environment.
