This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration data - all of which can be vital to both npm and to the end users of the package. The package.json file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal package.json:\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"barebones\",\r\n  \"version\" : \"0.0.0\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nNever include node modules they are too large ! \r\n\r\nnodemon will change things automatically\r\n\r\nnpm install \r\nwill uninstall the node modules \r\n\r\nnpx \r\nrun packages globally or locally \r\nWhen you run a package using NPX, it searches for the package in the local and global registry, and then it runs the package.\r\n\r\nIf the package is not already installed, NPX downloads the package files and installs the package,\r\n but it will only cache the files instead of saving it.\r\n npx some-package\r\n \r\n \r\n What is an event loop \r\n \r\n \r\n A blocking operation occurs when the execution of javascript operations is pulsed and must wait for a non-javascript operation to complete executing. By non-javascript operations, I mean operations like reading or writing data to a file, making a network request, reading or persisting data to a database e.t.c.\r\n \r\n Promises have resolve and reject \r\n \r\n \r\n Async/Await makes it easier to write promises. The keyword \u2018async\u2019 before a function makes the function return a promise, always. And the keyword await is used inside async functions, which makes the program wait until the Promise resolves.\r\n Async await helps wait for PROMISES to resolve \r\n \r\n util module \r\n say \r\n const util = module('util');", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyfMsS9CdZsdga9knZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-19T13:07:12Z", "author": "Clash of Design", "text": "1:16:54 my writefilesynch is showing error no such file or directory", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxER-LAFIbaZZZ1C6l4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-18T12:57:52Z", "author": "Eric Cheong", "text": "For the HTTP Module at around the 1:45:00 mark.
