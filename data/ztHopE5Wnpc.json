You keep the students attention by making us laugh.  Thank you!\n\nThe word \"attribute\" can be used as a noun (to represent a THING), or as a verb (to describe an action, something one DOES).   Each usage has a unique pronunciation.\nWhen used as a verb, as in the sentence:  \"I attribute the barking to my neighbor's dog.\" the stress falls on the 2nd syllable.   at-TRI-bute\nWhen used as a noun, as in the sentence:  \"Water has two extremely important attributes.\"  the stress falls on the 1st syllable.  AT-tri-bute\nStress is also sometimes referred to as emphasis or accent.  I am denoting stress with capital letters.   Here are some other examples:\nre-LA-tion\nEN-ti-ty\nDA-ta-base\nA-na-lyst\na-NA-ly-sis\n\nMy point\u2026  You are using the WRONG pronunciation dude, and it seriously calls your credibility into question.

If an instructor does know how to pronounce one of the most basic words that is fundamental to the topic, how in the world am I supposed to have confidence that he actually knows what he's talking about?\n\nYou are clearly using attribute as a noun, but you're using the pronunciation that indicates a verb.

Spreadsheets and Database are both powerful ways to store the data, and I do not necessarily agree with the examples for Excel vs Database, it would be probably easy to select the employees in Excel then learn how to write a proper query. They are different in another way - when you enter data to the spreadsheet it is your responsibility to maintain order and put correct information into the right cell. If you intended to put data into cell B5 but entered it into C5, Excel wouldn't inform you about this. In relational databases, there is a structure that you have to obey. I recommend checking Airtable.com to build a prototype and practice with database design, understand the tables and records,  (they have a generous free plan).\n_________added after watching all 8 hours (yay!!
