You keep the students attention by making us laugh.  Thank you!\n\nThe word \"attribute\" can be used as a noun (to represent a THING), or as a verb (to describe an action, something one DOES).

Been learning a lot so far. Thanks. \nThe question I have is for the example shown for 'Modality' at 5:34:00 . \nShouldn't it be that 'One card-holder can have zero or one card.' and not 'One card may be owned by zero or one owner.' ?\nAlso shouldn't there be a '0' or '|' indicated at the card_holder's side to indicate that 'one card can be owned by at least zero or one owner.'? \nI'm just learning this subject. So got a little confused. Replies would be very much appreciated.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy554nbwDzSWgvIDSp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-04-01T22:04:09Z", "author": "dksmoothtube", "text": "Good video however you are miss pronouncing attribute", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugy554nbwDzSWgvIDSp4AaABAg.9_IH8KbKEqF9aCaIzjD_LU", "publishedAt": "2022-04-24T13:36:19Z", "author": "DJJonPattrsn22", "text": "well, kind of\u2026  I was just going to say the same thing.\nHe's not actually mispronouncing the word.

So when Customer fills out form they press submit and data is entered into DB .\n\n\n** On any data The data can be SEARCHED  for FREE ($ 0 ) \n\n\n\nI DO NOT  want this to be a Subscription / nor Membership site.  \n\n\n** ALSO   I want ALL DATA to AUTO DELETE  from the database after a set time period from the date of submission.\n\n\nDo you have any videos on these aspects of DB COLLECTION AND USE ????", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyfClQ9SEjM20w4TkR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-14T10:35:15Z", "author": "abukar jeyte", "text": "I realy exiting any update of datta basr lime", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyjIkBxBWxAl05x8oN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-10T06:23:10Z", "author": "drop_messages", "text": "8 hour video, check\nusing a chalk board, because old school (as in teaching style, not tech) teachers are the best., check\nno ads, check\none guy, talking about one topic for 8 hours, in a free video check\n.....

Spreadsheets and Database are both powerful ways to store the data, and I do not necessarily agree with the examples for Excel vs Database, it would be probably easy to select the employees in Excel then learn how to write a proper query. They are different in another way - when you enter data to the spreadsheet it is your responsibility to maintain order and put correct information into the right cell. If you intended to put data into cell B5 but entered it into C5, Excel wouldn't inform you about this. In relational databases, there is a structure that you have to obey. I recommend checking Airtable.com to build a prototype and practice with database design, understand the tables and records,  (they have a generous free plan).\n_________added after watching all 8 hours (yay!!
