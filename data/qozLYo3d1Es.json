Your comments about free vs paid resources and what it really takes to learn how to code is the same experience I have had. A decent computer, Internet connection, and electricity is the financial investment. Because I live in the United States, I take this for granted. There are people smarter and more dedicated than me living in countries around the world that don't have access to these basic resources and utilities. There are people in the United States that also don't have access. The biggest investment is time, dedication, and developing one's search skills.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugij1I6rbEnEcHgCoAEC", "publishedAt": "2017-01-09T14:26:43Z", "author": "MoriceTheOne", "text": "Totally awesome !", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UghQXvghtp6vaHgCoAEC", "publishedAt": "2017-01-09T13:44:26Z", "author": "Ushio", "text": "I think it's awesome Vlog, keep it going.
