Is it possible to get VSCode to do the following in a simple and straightforward manner:   1.  Build a workspace with one or more Roots with each root node allowing only a sub-set of the file system underneath.   2.  Get VSCode to build tags (whatever it is called) in the background so that lookups of symbol definitions is fast. I felt VSCode is many times slower than vim.  3. Show definitions of of symbols such as structs, macros, functions, etc in POPUP ballons rather than open them in a separate editor window.
