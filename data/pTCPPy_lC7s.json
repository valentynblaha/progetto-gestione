Don\u2019t use new functionality in performance critical code, there\u2019s no point optimising until we get data from the real world. Benchmarks don\u2019t mean much. Open source is good etc, we\u2019re on GitHub. Nerd talk. It\u2019s hard to optimise with node.js because you don\u2019t always see the code published.
