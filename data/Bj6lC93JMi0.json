But the fine balance of abstraction and encapsulation here is inspiring. \n\nFor the purpose of enhanced readability and curbing complexity, is it common practice to write many concise functions or fewer in-depth functions. \n\nFor example, my blackjack game required at most 11 functions. But the algorithms were sometimes 10+ lines. Hit, fold, stay, low bet, med bet, high bet, play again, reset, counter, check for aces, and check results. Some were also nested within each other. \n\nFor example, the counter kept track of the sum of a list of integers. A new randomly generated number would be added to the list when the hit button was clicked. Immediately after, the counter function is called where it sums the list and returns the value. But before summing the total, it checks for aces. While doing so it loops through the list and determines if an 11 is present. If so, it checks the new sum and if the new value brings the sum over 21, it changes the 11 to a 1.\n\nImmediately after running the 'check for aces' function, it sums the list and checks for aces yet again, before running the rest of the hit function which will now create the new element with the appropriate class and id, as well as the src of the image according to the newly generated random value. Conditions for busting are set within the counter function as well. \n\nBut my question is, when does big O notation become problematic. And will the \"many simple functions\" technique make the computation more efficient?\n\nIt's probably a fairly simple question. But before a month ago, I hadn't known anything about comp sci. I'm actually starting a degree program next month and I've been running off of 4 hours of sleep per day these last few weeks out of pure interest and curiosity.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzIvyof9sNsaefHahB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-17T06:37:52Z", "author": "RomieVTheDon", "text": "I finished coding a blackjack game from scratch in javascript last week without any guidance, and I have a feeling when I finish watching this I'm gonna feel less satisfied with my effort\ud83d\ude02", "likes": 5}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwKy6nUg6PaNRgyeq94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-16T14:31:56Z", "author": "Lakshyajeet Jalal", "text": "53:18 return should be outside forEach loop.", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwKy6nUg6PaNRgyeq94AaABAg.9jhNGpNVRgK9kfgpYeSnyb", "publishedAt": "2023-01-09T19:24:29Z", "author": "Gabriel de Monts", "text": "saved me", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwKy6nUg6PaNRgyeq94AaABAg.9jhNGpNVRgK9k6RxgYado1", "publishedAt": "2022-12-26T17:33:08Z", "author": "ko to", "text": "my man you are my hero", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzPu5Z717F7qh5FK4t4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-16T14:14:36Z", "author": "ASN - Relaxing Music", "text": "Hello\nHow to write macro for whole directory in epsilon code editor\nFor changing numbers in whole directory please reply me", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwcE-kk3opj1dgZb2N4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-15T22:03:08Z", "author": " The Bottle Cracker", "text": "Hello, Im a beginner coder, I am getting a error message that says \"no module named pygame\".\nwhat do you suggest I do to fix this?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwcE-kk3opj1dgZb2N4AaABAg.9jfb6cZAJ4c9jy9Xo255hv", "publishedAt": "2022-12-23T02:59:01Z", "author": "G Man", "text": "It sounds like you're programming in Python.

Like your goal to programing .io games, challenging yourself by reproducing website interface is the best way to progress in html/css.\n\u2028Then you can start learning Javascript to add some client side interactions. \n\nIf you want to develop .io games, you can start by programing simples game in html canvas with Javascript. There are a bunch of tutorial on YouTube that deal with all concepts like animation loop, javascript render loop and oriented object programing. Your goal is cool ! Be curious by exploring different other type of web experiences.\n\n\u2028For your .io game you will need a server and broadcast datas in real time between players. Node.js is perfect for server side and Websocket permit real-time data transfer from and to the server (and clients). Some years ago at school, we made a skribbl.io with Node.js, Websocket, html/css and vanilla Javascript on client side. That was sick and relatively easy, then its opened our mind on crazy posibility of Javascript. By the way you can develop mobile app, desktop app, big web plateformes by using Javascript. Its very powerful and permissive :)\n\n\u2028Then if you want to develop websites with dynamiques datas you can learn frameworks and librairies like Vue.js or React.js. They give you tools and build in feature than permit you to develop faster and better websites. Moreover, CMS like Prismic are awesome to quickly build dynamic websites with admin and pages editor, you can provide datas for your pages.\n\nThat first part of your journey may during 1 ou 2 years depending on your motivation and implication. Keep in mind that the most important is to learn & understand programing & architectures concepts. A good developer can easily switch on a new langage or framework if he know his basis. And depedanding on you next goals, you might be exploring other programing domains like data science, databases, mobile dev or IOT !\n\nI thing JavaScript is the best choice for your goal. Yes you can make website with Java, games in Python and IA with phone lines (yes). But based on web's directions and trends, that the best language for a beginner with your goals. And the vanilla Javascript keep evolving ! \n\nLearning python for web develpment is like learn painting with a woodstick, you can paint but you will be quickly limited !\n\nI hope I helped you, good luck on your journey ! Youtube channels like this one are awesome to learn / improve your skills !\n\nThis video may help you for your firsts websites https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fb2aPlgoys", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxfRglxbE4KPEA1fSR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:16:13Z", "author": "Rishi Raj", "text": "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgykNG4ca71oFOY8sUl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:13:32Z", "author": "Shaken", "text": "I don't really think that the animation is that great..", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwhDwyC4bapfSFEhKV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:11:10Z", "author": "Tomiwa Pelumi", "text": "Y\u2019all are the best", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzbO9modEr1P7-3EoJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:08:48Z", "author": "Tejas with me", "text": "1st comment!!!\nViewing when 1min till publish.\n\u263a\ufe0f \nWe are all getting better day by day \u2764\ufe0f", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxKcSpEoLc5DTQt1wB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:08:21Z", "author": "manav", "text": "Awsome channel..... thank you for support sir\u2764\ufe0f", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzbZTtCgk2jkopfMSh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:08:05Z", "author": "allthing", "text": "I've been waiting for this for a long time", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwtqm2r62GASv5pCMR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:08:02Z", "author": "Tech Worthy Mind", "text": "Second \ud83e\udd48 Comment", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxI49XgmEVREcLbRkB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:07:50Z", "author": "Aryan Gamer", "text": "First", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzOZ6AeYJ8Bw9Q3IQ14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-14T15:07:16Z", "author": "TechGyanWithMaan", "text": "Suii", "likes": 3}}]}
