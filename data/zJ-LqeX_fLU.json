Arduino is an easy-to-use, open-source electronics platform. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.\n\nNo hardware is required for to follow along with this course!\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course developed by Ashish Bansal.\n\ud83d\udcf8 Ashish on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ashish_things/\n\nTinker with the circuits used in the course : \n\ud83d\udd17 custom blink function: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ib4c08HDTAe\n\ud83d\udd17 digitalRead & digitalWrite : https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bvTdKaqDvQc\n\ud83d\udd17 analogRead :  https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6kEEQR3GZC1\n\ud83d\udd17 analogWrite :  https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hDwWdu92kws\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fCourse Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\nSection 1: Objective of the course\n(0:00) Course Introduction\n\n(01:21) Section 2: Foundation of Electronics\n(01:36) Electricity \n(02:10) Static Electricity \n(03:37) Current Electricity \n(04:12) Voltage \n(06:09) Current \n(08:45) Resistance \n(10:05) Ohm\u2019s Law \n(11:55) Ohm\u2019s Law Example  \n(13:46) Resistances in Series and Parallel  \n(26:03) Resistance Color Coding\n\n(28:26) Section 3: Intro to Arduino Board\n(28:46) What is Microcontroller and Microprocessor \n(31:16) What category Arduino falls into? \n(31:33) Different Types of Arduino Boards \n(32:03) About Arduino \n(33:04) Parts of Arduino Uno \n(35:52) Technical Specifications of Arduino Uno\n\nSection 4: Intro to Arduino IDE \n(38:58) What is IDE? \n(40:14) Downloading and Installing the official IDE \n(41:51) Preparing your computer \n(43:08) Testing the Arduino.  \n(44:22) What if you don\u2019t have an Arduino board?\n\n\n(46:34) Section 5: Before we move ahead\n(47:04) What is breadboard? \n(49:16) How to make connections in breadboard? \n(1:00:10) Some safety instructions and Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts  \n(1:01:53) Input & Output \n(1:08:47) Analog & Digital \n(1:14:04) Bit & Byte\n\n(1:16:26) Section 6: Arduino Programming\n(1:16:46) Introduction \n(1:17:41) The First Step into Programming \n(1:19:37) Bare minimum structure of an Arduino Program\n(1:20:21) Comments \n(1:21:37) White Spaces and Case Sensitivity \n(1:24:06) pinMode \n(1:26:44) digitalWrite and delay \n(1:29:51) Camel casing\n\nSection 6.1 Introduction to Variables and Data Types\n(1:30:51) What are variables and data types  \n(1:31:31) Int data type \n(1:35:11) Arithmetic operators \n(1:41:51) Incrementing and Decrementing our variables \n(1:44:14) Float data type \n(1:46:48) Bool/Boolean data type \n(1:49:24) Byte data type \n(1:50:27) Char data type \n(1:52:46) Conclusion \n\nSection 6.2 Variable Scope and Qualifiers\n(1:53:19) What is Scope?

This course will begin with the basic electronics concepts and then gradually teach about Arduino Programming. Arduino's programming language is derived from C++, so this course will also cover essential C++ concepts. \n\nDuring my time working with Arduino, I have seen many people building great projects and product prototypes using this piece of hardware. Artists, designers, and even chefs who had absolutely no idea about electronics, sensors, and programming coupled their creativity with electronics and came up with fantastic work. \n\nSo this course is also an attempt to encourage people, regardless of their background, to start building stuff that they have in their mind without thinking that they don't know enough to begin. \n\nCertainly, this course is not the end to the world of Arduino. For making some projects, one may need to know advanced concepts such as EEPROM, interrupts, communication buses like SPI, I2C, etc. But before moving to that, one needs to familiarize themselves with the basics.\n\nI look forward to seeing the projects people come up with after finishing this course.", "likes": 602}, "replies": [{"author": "Erl Winter", "text": "Great video Ashish.

With the Arduino I can access hundreds (if not thousands) of sensors and actuators and controllers and I can access the real world without purchasing expensive test equipment from National Instruments or other vendors. I don't think I would want to be an Arduino-only engineer, but being able to use the Arduino has been a fantastic skill to add to my skill set. Recently I have started fabricating Arduino-based PCBs through EasyEDA, and that has again expanded my reach. Now I can make robust test fixtures without having a ball of wires. I recently landed a new job and, after I had been there a short time, my boss said they had no idea what they were getting when they hired me, I exceeded all expectations and surprised them with my solutions.
