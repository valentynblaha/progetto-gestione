We'll cover how Python provided the key glue between the SNES emulator and AI, and how the AI was built with gym, keras-rl and tensorflow. We'll show examples of game play and training, and talk about which bot beat which bot in the bot-v-bot tournament we ran.\n\nTalk given by Adam Fletcher and Jonathan Mortensen at PyCon 2018.\n\nThanks to PyCon for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.

When humans train, we identify the intermediate steps needed to get good results like we practice a certain combo and then optimize for the opportunity to connect them in the main game. We get rewards just for timing those things right. But AIs don't specifically target for them. That makes it so it wanders around all the time. So even with a lot of training power, a lot of training power is wasted training for useless things. It's true that it helps finding out of the box solutions but most of the time you get unoptimized solution. You can see that with just that running 100m (forgot the game name) video. He used input from a master as a priori for the engine to optimize. This way the AI doesn't have to wander around and settle for a local minimum that's very far from the globally optimized solution.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxrw5h6uSXu8a9UjNV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-01T15:09:25Z", "author": "Moto Aventura", "text": "I'm trying to build an AI to play SF2CE arcade version and I'm wondering why you don't show any results on video...", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz6LGiYpCAAww1wB8h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-15T21:02:41Z", "author": "Aupheromones", "text": "Show me an algorithm that can win with Balrog, and I'll be impressed.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugz6LGiYpCAAww1wB8h4AaABAg.9DdUZRCjGqf9FvhlSFTN0E", "publishedAt": "2020-11-11T15:55:54Z", "author": "Mr. Hippopotamus", "text": "Wall up > grab > 1+ input per frame > gg", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxneTw5FDAW8yrSMnF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-11T10:26:11Z", "author": "nesterzhzhot", "text": "where can I take a full code o this?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzThG49GDR10_hUZ5x4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-04T14:34:04Z", "author": "nesterzhzhot", "text": "If this is for beginners, than I don t like it, because there are a lot of info, that I needed to know, but they didn t tell.\nIf not, than why they gave so many facts, that pro python programmers already know?\nAnyways, I liked this video, good job!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxLPAt-I-cELiYaPG94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-06-10T04:05:32Z", "author": "MavVRX", "text": "What does the agent do when the player swaps sides?
