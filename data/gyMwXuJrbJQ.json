So it is so good that you provide such good materials for me to learn and transit my skills from Web 2 to Web 3. Just finish Lesson 0 and 1. Will continue to learn from the rest of the lessons. Very excited to learn about Remix in lesson 2. Hopefully, once I complete all the lessons, I will be able to contribute to the blockchain/smart chain community for developing a new era for the human history!!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw6NYxtoUUXqegtjht4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-05T13:32:40Z", "author": "Aarush Kashyap", "text": "This one is a very cool course, thank you for this", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxz_vgEmTZcOW-BjjJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-05T13:31:38Z", "author": "Aarush Kashyap", "text": "Can we have a Solana development course ?", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxXDxzAJE1FkO7EqUx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-05T12:57:31Z", "author": "m\u03c3\u01dd", "text": "Awesome!
