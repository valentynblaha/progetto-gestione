Every high level language is the same, at core:\n- 3 common data types: strings (or arrays of characters), numbers, and booleans, stored in memory and accesed later through labels which we call variables;\n- operators: arithmetic and logical;\n- conditionals: the logic happens here, based on one or more boolean (logical) expressions;\n- loops: repetition, repetition, repetition;\n- functions: reusable blocks of code which may be seen also as a list of instructions grouped together and labeled, which performs a particular task given some (or none) inputs, and may return some (or no) value(s);\nThose are the main parts of any high level programming language.
