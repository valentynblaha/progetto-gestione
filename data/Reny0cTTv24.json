As with all such tutorials, you'll get the most out of it by going back and experimenting with all the things you can add, modify, expand, etc. Obviously, there is only so much Sloba could include here or the video would be several hours long. In this case, really exploring the API documentation to see what you can get from the API and then how you can use that data is very helpful in learning about working with REST APIs.\n\nAs I saw from one other commenter, the tutorial does misinterpret what the forecast list array provides. The 40 items in that array are not consecutive daily forecasts, but rather they are consecutive hourly forecasts separated by 3 hours. The API returns 5 days of data and there are 8 3-hr segments in a 24-hr day, hence the count of 5 x 8 = 40. So, to be accurate, you would need to do more data manipulation to really be able to extract a multi-day forecast from this data, and it would only look forward at most 5 days (unless you upgrade to the paid version of the API). But, the point of this tutorial is to show an example of accessing and displaying REST API data, not building an amazing replacement for the current weather app on your phone.\n\nOne last thing - new devs need to learn about protecting API keys. If you intend to upload this project to a public GitHub repo, then you need to learn about how to do it without exposing your personal API keys. Google \"how to hide api key in github\" for the how and why of this issue. (e.g., If you look at Sloba's Github repo for this tutorial, you will see he put placeholders in for the keys.)", "likes": 22}, "replies": [{"author": "GFore", "text": "@Abhyuday Soni - In this case, it is not a big deal since the API key is free so you aren't really trying to protect anything.
