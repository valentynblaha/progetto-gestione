In the usePlayer.js file the resetPlayer callback function is \n\n  // const resetPlayer = useCallback(\n  //   () => {\n  //     setPlayer({\n  //       pos: { x: STAGE_WIDTH / 2 - 2, y: 0 },\n  //       tetromino: randomTetromino().shape,\n  //       collided: false,\n  //     });\n  //     console.log(player.tetromino);\n  //   },\n  //   [player, setPlayer],\n  // );\n\nSometimes this callback function does not setPlayer properly, and through console logging I was able to deduce that sometimes that his function doesn't properly work. I thought I could fix the problem by changing the resetPlayer into a async function,\n\n  const resetPlayer = async () => {\n    await setPlayer({\n      pos: { x: STAGE_WIDTH / 2 - 2, y: 0 },\n      tetromino: randomTetromino().shape,\n      collided: false,\n    });\n  };\n\nBut really the problem is that the setPlayer hook function, when it sets the shape with a random tetromino can sometimes give out a undefined shape. The async function did not fix this problem, nor did ensuring that the randomTetromino function, if(randtetro !== undef) then return definedRandTetro. I was able to alleviate the problem though by adding an if statement under the callback.\n\n if (resetPlayer && player.tetromino === undefined) {\n    resetPlayer();\n  }\n\nThis catches the undefined tetromino and calls it to run again. I wasn't to be fix the problem but I was able to catch undefined tetrominos this way.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzmL-dzCCMb0GIoE9h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-10T06:19:15Z", "author": "Matthew Tang", "text": "nice game, thank you!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwgcZlrtFkx0Va_ymt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-09T02:44:53Z", "author": "Algorhythmic", "text": "Extremely helpful.
