This type of error happens when it's actually an html file (that's why it's starting with \"<\") instead of json file. \nSo to check that error, you would do this: in fetch process, when using \nfetch(APILink)\n.then(res => res(text()) //so you can convert it to plain text\n.then(text => console.log(text) //if you get results in console, it means that the structure of the file wasn't JSON, but HTML.\n\nWhy that would happen?
