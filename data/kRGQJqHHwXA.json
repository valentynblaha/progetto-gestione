So, its called faster on devices which has high fps and slower on devices which have slow fps.\n\nSo if we used \"current_Platform_Spawn_Timer++;\" then the incrementing time is different across devices since the function (Update) is called at different times on different devices as explained above.\n\nUsing delta time, the increment is close to the same across all devices. Thats how delta time works.\n\"platform_Spawn_Timer\" is actually a constant value which the \"current_Platform_Spawn_Timer++;\" compares too.\n\nI think this is what happens and if Im wrong, do correct me :)", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxgwQHk3RTZYxbHbgR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-05-02T13:01:59Z", "author": "Ram Bhardwaj", "text": "Hi", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxVrKZ2_WMe94cz4Bh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-04-19T19:44:36Z", "author": "Takrim's Channel", "text": "Haha bro.
