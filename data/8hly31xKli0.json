There are three main parts to this course: algorithms, data structures, and a deep dive into sorting and searching algorithms.\n\nBy the end, you will understand what algorithms and data structures are, how they are measured and evaluated, and how they are used to solve problems.\n\nThis course was developed by Pasan Premaratne and Jay McGavren.

It then repeats the function.\n\n However if the target is 3, the code checks the first statement as this is not true so it goes to the else statement: \nreturn recursive_binary_search(list[:midpoint],target)---  here you are returning list[1,2,3,4,5,6] i.e. index 0 to 5 (see if you minus one then value 6 would be missed out and that value was not returned by the above value (7-10).
