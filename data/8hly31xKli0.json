Consider having a list of 16 8-bit integers.\n\nLet's assume that iterative version should use 16 bytes of memory to store list, ignoring the overhead of lists for simplicity.\n\nThe recursive version starts with 16 bytes, then creates a new list of 8 bytes, a new list of 4 bytes, a new list of 2 bytes, a new of 1 byte, and finally an empty list. That's a total of 31 bytes. This will never be more than 2x the size.\n\nI understand the worst-case time notation of log2(n) where n = 16 gives us 4, which the number of loops or recursion depth required.\n\nThe video says that the space notation is also log2(n) (https://youtu.be/8hly31xKli0?t=6661).\r\n\n\nThis is very confusing to me. The answer of 4 doesn't translate to the actual space being used. It's only using ~2x the amount of space, not 4x.\n\nIn my opinion, it makes more sense to specify the space using a different notation. For example, the space required for the iterative function is O(n) and the space required for the recursive function is O(2n).", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyf851IcJD7JxGrRTp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-07T11:19:28Z", "author": "Med Medin", "text": "Please let Pasan do all the talk, he is easy to understand, for me as no native english speaker the last part was really hard to follow with that accent.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyGUHA9mva1IGxRX7l4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-05T14:29:26Z", "author": "abcd efg", "text": "Best DSA course ever!

Lastly, I haven't see them 'couse I'm still in this one, but all except one are from freeCodeCamp as well and they seem as good as this.\n\nSo, i would go like these:\n\n1. Go with more Data Structures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM&list=PLKGSk1UzPVhwvqlGpW2LZjSQeJkwRTTpL&index=5\n\n2. Here you have a complete course for analysis and design algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Q_wHrzxDs&list=PLKGSk1UzPVhwvqlGpW2LZjSQeJkwRTTpL&index=3\n\n3. In this one they focus on dinamic programming. I assume that the link #2 will cover that but i guees this can bring some info too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&list=PLKGSk1UzPVhwvqlGpW2LZjSQeJkwRTTpL&index=6\n\n4. And finally (And maybe as an extra) here you have a course from algorithms related to graphs theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09_LlHjoEiY&list=PLKGSk1UzPVhwvqlGpW2LZjSQeJkwRTTpL&index=2\n\nI'm not native speaker so sorry if i mispronounce something, especially the word mispronounce xD, but anyway i hope this can help u to learn more :)", "likes": 13}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy4HR2sDzNECXEXLTt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-11T15:56:26Z", "author": "Mirza Abrar", "text": "\u09ad\u09be\u0987\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ad\u09be\u0987 \u09ac\u09bf\u099f\u09bf\u09ad\u09bf \u09a4\u09cb\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u0995\u09ae \u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09a1 \u09a6\u09c7\u09df\u0964 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6\u09c0\u09b0\u09be \u09b8\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09a6\u09be\u0993", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxrtudthe2VNWDgPFd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-11T14:24:19Z", "author": "Ashish Gautam", "text": "Thank you very much.. \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude09", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzAJKvboJzCu6UO7Kh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-09T20:17:46Z", "author": "Sagar Dobariya", "text": "Thank you", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyHZ6idt2x3-sIa_dh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-09T16:55:16Z", "author": "Tharindu Eranga", "text": "Does this cover graph theory?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxBOXVJCrnKjp6Trd54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-09T15:02:11Z", "author": "Siraj Sirajshabbir", "text": "2:23:00", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyDNO6DvsOeiH3fjt54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-08T11:22:20Z", "author": "bren", "text": "what should i study after watching this video?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw_XDQdsKGcHmrn9wp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-07T14:30:42Z", "author": "Adegbola Adeola", "text": "Very educative video, thank you", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzfK9M3hyOoj1YR-2x4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-06T15:47:35Z", "author": "Upendra De Zoysa", "text": "Proud of you Pasan Premarathne.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwvsRdDqwjGC-7PSFN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-05T08:52:37Z", "author": "Johnny T.", "text": "I would say its better to think of recursion as a stack.", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwvsRdDqwjGC-7PSFN4AaABAg.9OCO4NNX5cl9OP26VvP1vV", "publishedAt": "2021-06-10T06:50:47Z", "author": "kp", "text": "It is stack pushing every time a call and popping everytime returns", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz-hoDEmsMY7txMc0F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-03T20:42:32Z", "author": "Amazing Alex", "text": "10:00", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgynsA_sJnJ6uSAYrxN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-03T08:58:51Z", "author": "Daniel Simamora", "text": "1:04:23\n\ni swear i'll be back goddamnit", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwYibK9OLlnqN_4ZkV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-03T04:06:13Z", "author": "AjaxCodes", "text": "We made it!

Dare yourself, literally). In this case, there is a clear message about Usama's comment. That is, the freeCodeCamp is a life-saver. There is no need to argue that what he means is something life-threatening since it is already given that his words are hyperbole.\n\nAlso, your reply works on assumption that the only accepted definition of \"literal\" is the definition given by the dictionary. However, this is not the case, you are not writing a research paper or defending a case in a court, or any other instance that would require the usage of formal definitions. And even so, like what I have mentioned, when people say \"literal\" or \"literally\", in cases where there is little to no chance of ambiguity, what the person actually means is a hyperbole.", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgzDOKYd-6yOaHVDrvB4AaABAg.9L28adlQNd49MRGRijOihY", "publishedAt": "2021-04-22T10:31:42Z", "author": "abid rahman", "text": "@Daniel Mu\u00f1oz You guys are hounding him because of how he worded his comment - the intent is pretty clear.
