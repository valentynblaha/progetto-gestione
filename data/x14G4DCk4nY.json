Graphical programming languages usually do not last very long. Even nearly graphical programming languages such as Smalltalk (squeak) are far from main stream. And if kids learn to use scratch at say age 12, they have a maximum time of about 2 years where it makes sense. 14-16 year old kids should be able to use an editor, not only for programming but also for vanilla text editing (homework, email, ...). Logo was an older incarnation of scratch (in spirit) and good old basic might be easy enough for even 12 year old kids to master.\n\nI used to teach 14 year old kids with Pascal and because graphics is what keeps kids motivated, I wrote a small and simple graphics library for them to use. And they had no problems to get small things done. This was in 1990. While I would not use Pascal now in 2021, I still think even 12 year old kids might be able to handle some typing in a text editor. \n\nGiven (at least in Germany), kids start to learn English around the age of 8, it might even be a good idea to show them an application for them learning a foreign language. So, there is no need for localized programming languages. We learned that back in the day when MS Office had localized Visual Basic and it was a mess.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Abhi and Avika\u2019s Vlog", "text": "this the most fucking i have ever made", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pixel Muffin Studios", "text": "hello my name is Demi and  i'm 8 years old.I like your video keep it up\u263a\ufe0f", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pixel Muffin Studios", "text": "I like your video but is that mine went wrong.Keep working hard and don't let anyone give you a thumbs down.", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "V5ndis", "text": "Hello i have a problem.
