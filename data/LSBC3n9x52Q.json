And in this video I will be giving you three tips on how to learn Discrete Mathematics. The first tip is to stay calm. People often hear the word Mathematics and panic. When you panic, you stop listening. If you stop listening, you can't learn the material. If you simply stay calm, then you'll be able to learn the material better. You aren't being graded on the subject so there's no need to panic. The second is to rewind. You can rewind the videos at any time. When I learned Discrete Mathematics I didn't have this opportunity. In theory you should be able to learn the material much faster than I was ever able to. I strongly encourage rewinding the video. Finally, explain. Once you think you understand the material of the videos you can try to explain the material out loud either to yourself or to a friend. If no one is around, or you feel weird talking to yourself then you can try and explain it to a rubber ducky. There's a concept in Programming called Rubber Ducky debugging, which is where programmers go through their code, line by line, trying to identify bugs in their code by explaining it to a rubber ducky. So similarly, if you go through the material of the videos, subject by subject, you will soon be able to identify any gaps in your understanding of the material.\n\n\n\nWe're busy people who learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits.
