I like the way you scaffolded the project, but I am a bit confused on how in production it would play out.\n\nIn dev mode, I understand what's going on. You have a client server (8080) and a API server (8081) that are essentially connected by the AJAX call via Axios.\n\nBut for production, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm under the assumption that you are not going to have those two servers anymore so you are going to have to modify to the AJAX call to the correct endpoint (where in dev mode it was just http://localhost:8081/). What I'm stuck on is: What exactly is that new endpoint going to be and how do you host it? Perhaps for simplicity sake, how would I go about hosting this for production using the service you mentioned called Amazon S3?\n\nThank you for the awesome tutorial!", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgwtFojKpyr2FqDCpTR4AaABAg.8ZiRkwlgm8C8ZmkqSXVrTC", "publishedAt": "2017-11-10T13:28:18Z", "author": "Em Ji Madhu", "text": "yes you do", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwz_NFBH1lt7cjsr994AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2017-11-08T17:14:13Z", "author": "DeNiE714", "text": "Help me please!!\nAfter pressing \"Set As Bookmark\" the song is added to \"Bookmarks\", and \"Unset As Bookmark\" appears, you can delete the song from \"Bookmarks\".
