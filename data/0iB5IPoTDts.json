However, the flask app does not keep likes in its db, so the number of likes is not received back and is not reflected on the 'localhost:3000' page; and on hitting the Like button, 'NoN' is shown instead of a number.\n\nAfter changing the port in that fetch() to '8000', which makes the GET sent to Admin/Django instead, the likes on localhost:3000 work ok. \n\nAlso, the number of likes in the Admin/Django db may mismatch such number on the localhost:3000 on hitting the Like button many times, because the Django app will not increment it for a repeated  user id - product id pair while the number of likes on  the page is incremented irrespectively.
