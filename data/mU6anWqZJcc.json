Just landed my first programming job yesterday.\n\nFor those who wanted to know more about my journey:\n\nI started teaching myself web dev while in school for computer science a few weeks before my second semester of college. Over the next like 6 months, I kept learning and making projects. I taught myself in this order: HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node using Express.js, then PostgreSQL. \n\nBefore I started teaching myself, the only experience I had with programming was an intro to programming class in college where we learned the fundamentals of programming using Java. I really didn\u2019t do much programming in school during my first year of college. Other than that, I learned everything else about programming through YouTube videos. I thought learning web dev could help me build my resume and get some internships. I wasn\u2019t planning on applying to jobs while I was still in school at first.\n\nAfter that, i kinda stopped programming outside of school for a while because tbh i kinda got a little burnt out. \n\nA few months later, two weeks before the second semester of my sophomore year, I started applying to part-time remote web dev jobs because I didn\u2019t get any internships. Eventually, I got accepted into a job making $18 an hour working part-time, which isn\u2019t a huuuge amount for a web dev job, but great money for a broke college student.\n\nI work in front-end. My job only really requires me to use HTML, CSS, and JS. I work with a small team making educational games on the web for K-12 students.\n\nThe grind really sucked, but I guess it paid off in the end? I just remember just studying and coding every day for hours until my brain hurt. One of the hardest things I\u2019ve done. It sucked big time. Just glad that grind is over.", "likes": 738}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxmXEqVoAEknLW6Iel4AaABAg.9Xw3EvPvnE89jezcmy-Vl6", "publishedAt": "2022-12-15T16:18:08Z", "author": "ULtr4 Gamez", "text": "@Mikias Gurmessa guess what, my name is Mikias too.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxmXEqVoAEknLW6Iel4AaABAg.9Xw3EvPvnE89iiiQoInkBX", "publishedAt": "2022-11-22T06:33:23Z", "author": "Mikias Gurmessa", "text": "@ULtr4 Gamez yea, and you are too?", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgxmXEqVoAEknLW6Iel4AaABAg.9Xw3EvPvnE89ifqAi4Eo_z", "publishedAt": "2022-11-21T03:43:22Z", "author": "ULtr4 Gamez", "text": "@Mikias Gurmessa  hey ur Ethiopian aren't you", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxmXEqVoAEknLW6Iel4AaABAg.9Xw3EvPvnE89ifq5bhRKx8", "publishedAt": "2022-11-21T03:42:41Z", "author": "ULtr4 Gamez", "text": "so inspirational dude", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxmXEqVoAEknLW6Iel4AaABAg.9Xw3EvPvnE89gji5RWy707", "publishedAt": "2022-10-03T22:46:55Z", "author": "Tashea Nelson", "text": "Congratulations to you Sir", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxdT1MDfde-rtpNrmp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-01T20:31:46Z", "author": "Madiver", "text": "8:30 hrs in and coming back almost every day for 1-2 hours and some real testing afterwards.

Why should anyone learn HTML CSS, specially when you can create a beautiful website using only WordPress? With the \"Elementor Pro\" it's so easy to design a beautiful website. I mean I don't want provoke anybody. I just want to know why? Also in Fiverr, there's a lot of work for WordPress developers whereas I don't see many people asking for static HTML CSS developer. It makes sense because the clients wouldn't just want to be left off with a design that he cannot change. I mean with static HTML CSS, if a client isn't familiar with it, even to change a simple image, he'd have to hire somebody. But with WordPress, he can do it himself. It's very easy for the clients to manage a WordPress and because it has a good demand, WordPress developers can make more money whereas static HTML CSS developers can't.
