The switch evaluates \"Spoon\" against Cow, Giraffe, Dog, Pig. Because None of those are true, the code within the switch doesn't execute (so no break or no console log). So, it continues to the next switch statement. This time, it compares \"Spoon\" to Spoon, which fires back True to the switch. As a result, the code executes, and the console log and break goes through (the break exits the entire switch statement). Let's say he didn't have break there, just console log. Console log would execute, and then it would proceed to the next switch (dinosaur and default). since default will always execute to true, it's basically saying if animal === dinosaur || animal. (that is, animal has ANY value). so the last switch would execute too. As a result, you breaks are used to avoid that happening.", "likes": 10}, {"author": "Herbs", "text": "yeh im just stating out js but I don't rlly understand what break does in this loop", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jay LaVan", "text": "Free and concise, nice!", "likes": 5}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "pyro", "text": "break; not Break;", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Peter Romero", "text": "That was a terrible discussion of switch statements;.  totally confusing.", "likes": 6}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u0141ukasz Kiepas", "text": "Love youuuu", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Miguel Vargas", "text": "Got a little lost on how you got Friday for the first example..
