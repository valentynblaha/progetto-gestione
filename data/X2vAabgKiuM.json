It would depend on the institution or the professor you\u2019re working for. For example, some institutions will enrol lots of students who will then be able to do \u201crotations\u201d with different professors in the first year of their PhD before choosing their professor. PhDs like this might have more general computer science (CS) requirements so you might at least need to have taken a number of core CS modules (either as a CS undergrad or in engineering/maths etc). \n\nHowever there\u2019s lots of work related to NLP and knowledge of linguistics specifically is very useful to NLP, so you might want to search around and contact some professors to see what they say. Maybe add some code to github or do some basic CS MOOCs to alleviate any concerns about your lack of a CS background too.
