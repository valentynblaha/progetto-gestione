I found the test MUCH easier than what was reported online: the questions were very high level, mostly like 'why should you migrate to cloud' and what were the benefits. Questions about products were also quite obvious if you just had a minimal overview of what the products did (not even going in detail with the functionalities: just the general description were sufficient). I followed both this course and the official material. Stuff covered in the official material and the product cheat sheet they provide is more than enough to prepare this new version of the exam. I don't know if/when they changed the content of the exam again, but none of the questions you find online were present in my test (or even similar). This was my experience. This course was great nevertheless, it really helped cement the concepts and help you really understand the products, so thanks for providing it!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzvVkwNqzbFvOtPEQd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-28T21:43:07Z", "author": "Damian Prakash Murmu", "text": "Passed the exam just now!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw7OfxHdfLJ839_MOp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-27T08:35:15Z", "author": "ShayneAm", "text": "Thank you so much for this very great course.

I found the exam significantly easier than a number of the sample tests I'd undertaken on Whizlabs, ACloudGuru and ExamPro.  I think the sample tests may be a little out of date.  My exam included several questions on opex/capex models (quite a lot on this actually, surprisingly), role hierarchy, cloud benefits, structured/unstructured data.  While it did ask some questions about Cloud Run / App Engine / Functions et al, they weren't detailed (I wasn't faced with appengine standard vs flex situations, or cloud run vs app engine combinations). No networking questions at all, which surprised me.   Overall I would absolutely recommend this training course from Andrew for knowledge and confidence, but would now say it was a bit of a sledghammer to crack a nut - YMMV.

Learn about data storage solutions, differences and purposes for databases, data warehouses and data lakes. Study SLA, SLO. Didn't get any question on greenfield/brownfield, but I guess it's just random. They also asked about cloud treace and cloud debugger, and a few questions about security, and organization structure. Oh yes, and 2 questions about phishing and malware. Altogether 50 questions. Guys, I bought several exam dumps over the internet; they are all outdated and useless! Don't waste your money on those.

The difficulty of the questions was all over the place, kinda a mess to be honest: you might get a question that essentially asks like what a specific service is/done (i.e. super easy, what you'd expect on an introductory exam), then the next question might be something like about external identity provider integration and exactly where/what resource you would modify in the console to implement that integration (i.e. something I'd expect someone with like 3-6 months of hands-on experience to know).
