As a few of people said in comments, exam was changed, and they won't ask heavily technical questions. You still need to know about GKE, Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Run, what is a container and what is a VM. You also need to know the difference between Cloud Spanner and Cloud SQL. Learn about data storage solutions, differences and purposes for databases, data warehouses and data lakes. Study SLA, SLO. Didn't get any question on greenfield/brownfield, but I guess it's just random. They also asked about cloud treace and cloud debugger, and a few questions about security, and organization structure. Oh yes, and 2 questions about phishing and malware. Altogether 50 questions. Guys, I bought several exam dumps over the internet; they are all outdated and useless! Don't waste your money on those. The exam is way easier; it really covers information you get from google course itself. Learn it, take notes, and try practice exam questions; they are very similar to what you get on the actual exam. I'll be checking this thread for a few days, ask your questions here, and I'll try to answer.", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"author": "GrindingisLife", "text": "@caramelcheezit there's a free Google course, you can read it for reference, it helps a bit", "likes": 0}, {"author": "caramelcheezit", "text": "What's the Google course?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "GrindingisLife", "text": "@Saihati Could you please share the link of the official google course?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Just A Tip", "text": "@Saihati hey what all sources you use?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Saihati", "text": "Ok, I've passed the exam and got my certificate.
