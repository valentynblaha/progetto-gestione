I think this is more about going through the process of developing a NN. If you think the inputs are position of ship, position of asteroid, angle of ship, angle to asteroid. During training the network feeds through all that data and compare the NN output to the desired angle, by feeding back multiple times and adjusting weights you get weights that make the output very similar to the desired for any given input. In the actual game using predict the same inputs go into the feedforward (the network knows nothing about what any of those numbers are) the output with the preset weights makes the judgement on the left or right turn. So what is going in is an array of data and the network makes a decision to turn left or right based on the output. Of course in this simple type of games you don't need a network but it does nicely show the principles in my opinion :-)", "likes": 4}, {"id": "Ugx0CH8ptK_B6YH-4jF4AaABAg.8x9bXUP0W-p987tzzgcdPk", "publishedAt": "2020-05-01T22:41:43Z", "author": "Peter Ives", "text": "Yeah, just watched this and I thought the same thing.
