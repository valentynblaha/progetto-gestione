Use when some variable has no value assigned to them.\n\nUndefined - is not similar to null. means that a variable has either not been declared at all OR has been declared but holds no value. yield NaN if you do math with it. Is NOT zero.\n\nNumber - Watch in video.\n\nSymbols - Their instances are unique and immutable. so if two symbols, \n\nsym1 = Symbol (\"foo\") and sym2 = Symbol (\"foo\") are compared; sym1 === sym2 , it will give false.\nif you typecast them both to string, it will give true ! but typecasting to string also means that it will print like \"Symbol(foo)\" in console ...\n\nObject - It is a collection of properties.
