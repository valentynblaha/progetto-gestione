I just want to point out something: at around 1:31:00 you said that it's a best practice to use uniqueness in your database column for the item's description, but it's probably not. I'm not used to Flask (otherwise I wouldn't be here), but by saying that the description should be unique, everytime you create an item or update an item's description, the database will have to compare it to ALL other items descriptions. This comparison will probably be a quite expensive one.

For instance, what if i hzd three identical Iphones to sell, or 100 of them? Should I be forced to change the description of all of them to avoid them all being non-unique?\nI've worked with 400GB MySQL databases that got so slow because of fields being indexed like this, that we had to remove the unneeded indices.

The problem is that Django was designed with the \"enterprise\" project in mind and it is a lot of work to disable the stuff you don't need or do it with different tools or different style. In short, Django is more featureful and less flexible than flask. If you want a flexible lightweight framework for more different types of projects and don't mind learning more tools, use flask. I like flask better myself. I can avoid the tools I don't need rather than defeating them. In my opinion, flask is just as powerful and more customizable than Django. You will have to set up more, but you get your choice of what to set up.\n\nFor instance, say you want to use a database that isn't already set up for Django. Django makes it easy to choose your dbms at setup time for the choices it already has, but it is probably more difficult to get a new one working in Django than flask if there's already python support for it. I gave up on Django due to version conflicts with Django and sqlite3 because my linux distro didn't have the latest sqlite3 version. \n\nI also had issues changing configurations mid-stream with Django and ended up having to reinstall many times. I was also learning python web frameworks which made me feel like Django was hiding too much to allow me to learn. Flask was easier for me to learn because there was little functionality that was behind the scenes. I had to do more coding but I understood it better. When I get used to flask, I might retry Django but I'm staying with flask for now.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugz47e1Q1uqBXbv8G3J4AaABAg.9Ki65SQoKC29KinEDzpicr", "publishedAt": "2021-03-10T22:10:30Z", "author": "Stef", "text": "In my opinion Flask should only be used for small projects or serving data as an API.
