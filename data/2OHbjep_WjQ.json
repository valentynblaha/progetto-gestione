So I looked into it and here is what I found, the compiler is essentially complaing that something is being returned at all, for a class decorator is is possible to overwrite the constructor function but in this instance we aren't actually looking to overwrite anything, all we are doing is printing something to the console and then calling the constructor. From my experience calling the constructor is unnecessasary. It will be called regardless so in this case all we want to do is print something. I fixed my decorated by doing this;\n\nfunction classLog(target:Function){\n  console.log(\"I am a class decorator and I have just been invoked by the constructor for \" + target.name)\n}\n\n@classLog\nclass myExampleClass {\n  constructor(arg1:any, arg2:any){\n    console.log(\"Constructor fired!\")\n  }\n}\n\nWhen the JS is ran and the constructor for myExampleClass is called, before the constructor is executed the decorator is ran and then when its finished the original constructor is executed. \nI hope this helps.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxeBDp-QfNX7e7KJdd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-08T07:19:34Z", "author": "Kartik Choudhary", "text": "Is this tutorial still valid in 2022", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz7wOe9tERds6DlrVt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-21T01:17:49Z", "author": "Kunwar Pratap Singh", "text": "bad audio and bad flow of topics, un structured, if you can express more clearly it will be good", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugz7wOe9tERds6DlrVt4AaABAg.9cWbtnIpIjm9d7--eWfwTg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-05T22:59:37Z", "author": "Kawaii Coded", "text": "ikr I ma going to have to check traverse media video on this so, I can better understand.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyLbUwMjlKug8PveDV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-30T16:28:31Z", "author": "Naraksama", "text": "PHP?
