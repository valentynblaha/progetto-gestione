This means that if too many people are using your bot, it will get temporarily stopped. The second is the fact that all scripts are completely public unless you get the paid version, which means pretty much anyone can see pretty much anything you do. The tokens are stored online, which means when replit is compromised, your bot may be at risk. Another thing is their use of shared ips among users. In the context of bots, it means that if someone near you is banned for spamming requests/banned from discord, your bot will be stopped too because it\u2019s on the same ip. Lastly, it doesnt support hosting the bot 24/7. You need to use a third party website to stop replit from closing the program.

You are supposed to use the non-blocking aiohttp module for these purposes. https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean\n\n2) Used discord.Client throughout the video, even when the bot was centered around making commands. By now, it is common knowledge that you are supposed to be using the commands extension of discord.py and commands.Bot for this.\n\n3) Uses the repl.it db - which will also be blocking - same as point 1. You should be using a proper database, with a proper async driver module for it.\n\n4) Uses repl.it for hosting - this platform isn't made to be used for hosting. The fact that you have to be running a webserver continuously, just to keep the repl alive is proof enough for this. As it isn't built to be a host, it works as a rather poor host at that. (I can excuse this though, not wanting to pay for a host is fine, but definitely wouldn't recommend this.)\n\nTo any beginners seeing this, discord.py isn't a beginner's library. You should have at least some knowledge of python beforehand, at least till OOP (classes). If you don't, go now, learn it, and then come back to this. I spend time answering questions in a support server, and you will not believe how many beginners come asking the most basic of questions, because they didn't learn python first. Moreover, don't follow youtube tutorials like this one - the large majority of them are bad. Documentation is your best friend (these videos will become outdated as the library updates, but the docs will always give you the right info).", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyCpRftqDSSdXffZQh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-03-09T09:37:34Z", "author": "Prahar Jokhakar", "text": "I am too Lazy to type can someone send me the whole code I'll give you 10,000 Dank Coins if yes then DM me on Jethalal#9999", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyK25uLK-QR9HKKInB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-03-09T05:13:50Z", "author": "Tarak Kodi", "text": "Hey , My bot doesnt respond to the command i have given him! pls help", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyK25uLK-QR9HKKInB4AaABAg.9KeP5-AM-7v9LYLRHRVDGb", "publishedAt": "2021-03-31T07:58:38Z", "author": "Omkar Nag", "text": "If anyone needs help you can dm me on discord EtZed#4942", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyK25uLK-QR9HKKInB4AaABAg.9KeP5-AM-7v9L4zf75apwd", "publishedAt": "2021-03-19T22:21:42Z", "author": "Matthew Johnston", "text": "@Winifred yes i do but i spent 30 min making sure the code was the exact same", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyK25uLK-QR9HKKInB4AaABAg.9KeP5-AM-7v9L2G4SF2dyT", "publishedAt": "2021-03-18T20:56:07Z", "author": "Winifred", "text": "@Matthew Johnston do you get an error?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyK25uLK-QR9HKKInB4AaABAg.9KeP5-AM-7v9KvaTvdQ1CU", "publishedAt": "2021-03-15T21:29:11Z", "author": "Matthew Johnston", "text": "@Winifred can you pls explain it to me then because i spent 1 hour making sure it was that same", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyK25uLK-QR9HKKInB4AaABAg.9KeP5-AM-7v9Ku4adizGMD", "publishedAt": "2021-03-15T07:22:38Z", "author": "Winifred", "text": "@Matthew Johnston it does, you didn't do it right", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwotfnSSaiUsob69tV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-03-08T19:23:48Z", "author": "Mahyar Behzadi", "text": "thanks for this helpful course \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgweiHo8GOSvtME773l4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-03-08T15:00:59Z", "author": "Miguel", "text": "The algorithm gods have heard my pleas.
