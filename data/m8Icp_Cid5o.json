This allows systems to handle millions of users concurrently despite hardware failures.\n\nWe discuss the fundamental concepts of system design in this course like requirement selection, API design, Database Design, Network protocols, Fault-tolerance, design trade-offs, solution tradeoffs, and low-level design.\n\nGaurav Sen created this course.
