I am getting back into linux after many years and this is really helpful as a refresher. Your speed of delivery is perfect and I'm sure you've been refining your style over the last 3 years.  One comment for others who review this material....  When you ran your good-morning script, the error you saw was \"command not found\".  You stated the reason as a file permissions issue, but that's not accurate. If you had told the script from where to run the executable from: ./good-morning\" ,  you would have seen a \"permission denied\" error.  The the file permissions issue would be the cause of a  \"permission denied\" error, not a \"command not found error\". The \"command not found\" error was resolved by prepending the  ./ . I get why that fixed it, but without the dot-slash, is there a default directory or path that linux is looking to run the command from?  Where is default search path defined and is it editable?", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxjjtnmYofYQKh097N4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-04-28T13:00:06Z", "author": "Ivan Poberezhniuk", "text": "ty", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxG4aYoyXl7oz13kPV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-04-16T17:33:27Z", "author": "Calvin Ebun-Amu", "text": "I feel a lot more comfortable with bash after this.
