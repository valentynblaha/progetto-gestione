All data from a web service is provided at a single endpoint, and consumers can discover data schemas to then build and run queries to get only the data they need. The result is faster and more efficient development experience in many aspects of building and consuming the data layer.\n\nTalk by Daniel Lemay at the PDX Node meetup at OSCON 2018.\n\nThanks to PDX Node for giving us permission to share this talk.
