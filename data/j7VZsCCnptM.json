Cybersecurity is incredibly broad though, so you can find a use for most any language that you learn. If you want to have a good broad foundation you will need: \n\n- Javascript for anything web related \n- SQL for SQL injection\n- Python to understand hacking tools and write your own quickly and easily, also it is helpful to understand dynamic / interpreted programming languages.\n- C to understand low level programming concepts and compilers\n\nWhere you go from there is gonna depend on where your area of interest lies. Recently, more and more malware seems to use 'exotic' programming languages like D or Nim in an effort to avoid detection by AV software, so perhaps learning those will be helpful if you want to research those types of malware. If you wanna focus on Mac and iOS security, you need objectiveC and Swift. Those are just some examples. \n\nC++ and Java could also be useful, but the most important thing is that you get a good grasp of both (systems) programming and scripting. If you really understand that in one language, then other languages will be easy enough to pick up on an as needs basis. I recommend Harvard's CS50 if you are completely new to programming.
