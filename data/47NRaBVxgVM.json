I think I am better versed. I always look to see what these videos can teach me, but they always fall short BY YEARS! Another disappointment. I want to learn as I did then, but this wasted my time. Not hear to show off. The most popular card reader/punch in the IBM world was a 1401. Reader here reading card stock #5081: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0hDuCa_KlY\nIt was so fast we were not allowed to wear ties in the operating room because if your tie were caught in the reader, IBM would have to be called after they cut your tie and pulled you corpse away from the machine. The 5081 was reading 80 column cards, the 5096 was for 96 column cards. \n\nThe 5081 card, the most popular running in the late 1960's and 70's IBM 360 mainframe batch processors (even models in the 1950's). The older IBM 360's running OS would later go onto become IBM S370's. It was a beautiful era to grow up in. I dropped out of college because the pace of growth could not be documented and taught fast enough. I went on into mainframe operations in 1975 u=in an IBM S370 DOS/VS world. My roommate a programmer in the IBM S360's world coding applications. I went on to coding and an OS systems programmer and in that migration I wrote code to eliminate the card reader for batch processing. All while we were upgrading to IBM S370 MVSJES2 (Multiple Virtual Storage Job Entry Subsystem v2...the I/O spooler).\n \nI had written code to convert DOS JECL to JES2 JCEL. Oh what fun that was with the very limited technology we had in those days. I had to think outside of the circle every moment of my professional carrier. All of this predated today's aging z/OS and z/VSE.\n\nIf you are in college now studying Computer Sciences, you are already too late for your diploma to really do any good unless you have your foot in the door. Get a part time job as a mainframe computer operator ASAP!!! ...or your degree will not pay off from what your degree is in and where you want to be in the computer world. Operations only requires a very smart self-starting person. Stop watch YouTube, crack open the books and graduate ASAP. You will be challenged everyday, every minute of your life. I had to move to Houston to stay ahead. Be willing to sacrifice your and your families life. IBM is not going anywhere. They are never going out of business. How do you think the USA got to the moon and beyond? Find a US government mainframe operations job if you can running at least z/OS.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwKQLMf_8gjb-OEutV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-22T09:07:43Z", "author": "P D", "text": "Amazing video!

And lots of cherry picking. A couple quick examples. \n\n(a) Sure, you can look back and call the first packets sent \"over the Internet\" took place in 1969, but it certainly wasn't called the Internet then. Pre DARPANet or ARPANet would be more accurate, but that's even a stretch.  And well before, like 18 years, ARPA turned it over to NSF (NSFNet). \n\n(2) The Internet, as he says in his opening statement, \"didn't start in the mid 1990s\". That's patently false.  The commercial Internet that we have  today, where for-profit companies were allowed to send packets, began in 1990 when PSINet (then, Performance Systems International, a NYSERNet  spinoff which was a peer to MERIT), UUNet, and one other signed the CIX (Commerical Internet Exchange) in Marty Schoffstall's dinning room one night after dinner. That cleared the way for AOL and others to start to do their thing, legally.  Perhaps in making this statement about the mid 1990s he's referring to the birth of web technologies, Marc Andreessen and NCSA/Mosaic/Netscape's rise. But years before that, all the layer 1-4 companies were setting up the infrastructure necessary to power this thing.\n\nStill don't see any reference to the critical role that commercial organizations played. I don't want to downplay the role the regional networks (like Merit, NYSERNet, CerfNet, et al) played, but they were getting funding from NSFNet and previously DARPA. \n\nI guess I'll have to dive deeper into this.
