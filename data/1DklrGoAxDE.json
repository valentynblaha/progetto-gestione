Thank you for your interest in this course.\n\nThese are 3 reasons why should you learn 'class components' still.\r\n1) Many Enterprises still use class components-based react projects; they need people who understand, manage, update, support those projects.\r\n2) In many React interviews, they still ask few questions regarding class components - expecting you should have a background of 'class components' also - apart from functional components.\r\n3) For react beginners, it is very easy to understand many concepts like state, props etc., in class components.\r\nOnce they are good enough in class components, yes - they should learn 'functional components' as mentioned in this course.\n\r\nFull React course with 'functional components' is available on Udemy. It also includes with Redux (along with Redux toolkit) and JavaScript lectures to brush-up your JavaScript knowledge; because many React interviewers ask questions from JavaScript too.

This is happening because on line 59 the handleIncrement function uses the spread operator (i.e. [...this.state.products]) to  create a copy of the state and store it in allProducts. Although the array containing the products is now unique, it is not a deep copy. This means the elements inside are still referencing the same objects from prevState. In other words, products in allProducts are the same products from prevState so updating one will update the other. To fix this you will need to perform a deep copy of the product. This can be done using the map function:\n\nconst allProducts = products.map((p, i) => {\n                if (p.id === prod.id) {\n                  return { ...p, quantity: p.quantity + 1}; \n                }\n\n                return p;\r\n});  \n\n\nEssentially, when a product is incremented, compare the index with the index of the products in the array. When the index matches, make a unique copy and update the quantity.\nFinally set the state. If the console shows proper incrementing but UI doesnt your Products component may be resetting the value so check your Products component.\n\nHope this helps.", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgyFIr8gXzlyhOQSBsV4AaABAg.9UDrsmjbe4l9US2zLQC5oC", "publishedAt": "2021-11-07T14:04:30Z", "author": "D Israel", "text": "Have u figured this", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxrqcK4aekqkmT9EUV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-01T08:11:29Z", "author": "Ara Ara Ara", "text": "Wow I think I saw Steve jobs", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgynR2oUjsvwFzukq1h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-01T04:44:22Z", "author": "Data BR", "text": "About the comments in this video, I think people just forgot that it's almost 6 HOURS of free knowledge.
