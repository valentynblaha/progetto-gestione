It also includes with Redux (along with Redux toolkit) and JavaScript lectures to brush-up your JavaScript knowledge; because many React interviewers ask questions from JavaScript too.

In your example you identify that the previous state shows zeros across all shopping cart items when in fact it shows that the Samsung TV product has a quantity of 1.  This is the same value that you identify in the this.state.  Please check timestamp 4:13:40 for the prevState values and 4:13:51 for the this.state values", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"author": "Curioso", "text": "Hello, I ran into the same issue. This is happening because on line 59 the handleIncrement function uses the spread operator (i.e. [...this.state.products]) to  create a copy of the state and store it in allProducts. Although the array containing the products is now unique, it is not a deep copy. This means the elements inside are still referencing the same objects from prevState. In other words, products in allProducts are the same products from prevState so updating one will update the other. To fix this you will need to perform a deep copy of the product. This can be done using the map function:\n\nconst allProducts = products.map((p, i) => {\n                if (p.id === prod.id) {\n                  return { ...p, quantity: p.quantity + 1}; \n                }\n\n                return p;\r\n});  \n\n\nEssentially, when a product is incremented, compare the index with the index of the products in the array. When the index matches, make a unique copy and update the quantity.\nFinally set the state. If the console shows proper incrementing but UI doesnt your Products component may be resetting the value so check your Products component.\n\nHope this helps.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "D Israel", "text": "Have u figured this", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Anya", "text": "Wow I think I saw Steve jobs", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Data BR", "text": "About the comments in this video, I think people just forgot that it's almost 6 HOURS of free knowledge.
