Thank you for this video.  Much appreciated.  \nI have both a challenge and a request to gather all your good friends and companions here to URGENTLY build an application to track the movement of refugees.  I am horrified to see how women, children and their pets are fleeing from the war in Ukraine into the arms of human traffickers who offer them \"accommodation and protection\".  I also saw the same thing happen to Syrians who fled Aleppo.  We need to help refugees leave digital breadcrumbs, sound an alarm if their passports and phones are taken and help reunite them with their families at a later stage.  We need the best, most visionary, experienced, development team to get this done soonest because, I fear, things are going to get much worse before they get better.  Right now, not a single government is geared to monitor the safety of displaced humans. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nI personally do not have the technical expertise to launch and build such a significant product - that is why I am begging here for help.

I had a couple of questions: (I'm COMPLETELY NEW to this space) \n\n1) While finding the right open-source project to contribute to, how to check whether that community is active? I saw some 'good first issues' on some project that were raised few years ago (and still open) with some people showing interest, but that thread later either pointed to another issue or had no follow-ups, what does this mean? Do issues which get resolved, are marked closed, or they remain open?\n\n2) If I want to contribute to a project, do I read and understand it's entire functionality and the huge code-base? Because most of the time the issues that are raised make no sense as I'm having no context. If your answer is no, then how I proceed to contribute to the issue? If yes, then how do I read the huge code-base? Do people who regularly contribute to multiple projects, read the code-base and documentation so that they can contribute forever (long-term) or for one specific issue?\n\n3) If I find a new project and see the availability of 'good first issue', being completely new to the project, I'll take god knows how much time till I understand the project, won't the issue be solved till then? So I shall, pick and study a project and be prepared for upcoming issues, is that the strategy followed? If not, then what?\n\n4) Do you remember your first contribution? How long did it take you to understand the code-base? How did you do it?\n\nI realize, this list elaborate. I'd be grateful if you can provide your inputs to whatever extent :)\n\nThank you.", "likes": 35}, "replies": [{"id": "UgydCBNXfxK-Rg2ra4V4AaABAg.9OIkJJrzpxC9aZVeSaONHR", "publishedAt": "2022-05-03T11:09:30Z", "author": "himanshi rana", "text": "If you've started with open source...please could you help...as I'm a beginner too\ud83d\ude43", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgydCBNXfxK-Rg2ra4V4AaABAg.9OIkJJrzpxC9Rhyee-xLyP", "publishedAt": "2021-08-31T14:10:53Z", "author": "Eddie Jaoude", "text": "@Yi\u011fit E awesome! \ud83e\udd73 keep going \ud83d\udca5", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgydCBNXfxK-Rg2ra4V4AaABAg.9OIkJJrzpxC9Rhx21Mp7oD", "publishedAt": "2021-08-31T13:56:44Z", "author": "Yi\u011fit E", "text": "@Eddie Jaoude Thanks!
