So why is 'data science' and big data so focused on coding, SQL etc. IMHO, there is massive confusion out there:  Data science and data analytics are just two different things, they are related but different. Think about it as Formula 1 car and F1 driver:  The data scientists are the engineers that build the car, the data analytics is the driver that uses the car (the data) to win races.  Yet, in the 'big data' world, people expect one single person to have engineering skills (data management, database creation) AND piloting skills (analytics) whereas in the F1 context that would be absurd: An engineer who helps build the F1 car and a F1 pilot have completely different skills and roles.

What's problematic is when the mismatches tend to go in the same direction and reinforce each other. There are many good examples of this in social systems, but it also can happen in technical systems.

I don't like when you say your not doing data science because it doesn't fit in this bucket.

Considering sciences as meeting requirements is just like school that requires you to separate math, physics, and English into their own separate subjects. It is fine to teach the difference between the skills and I know that sometimes its important to see how they overlap as well. However, this isn't always practical and its actually more effective to have someone who has overlapping skills. Sometimes those skills are enough to even call that person a polymath. We shouldn't continue to teach things in isolation because that would create overspecialization. We are seeing overspecialization from people getting degrees from schools but unable to get good jobs with those skills. \n\nIt would be more productive to just say that it is an approach. Use that approach to design experiments using those approaches. Such as when you are playing a game like chess and you develop skills against one player.
