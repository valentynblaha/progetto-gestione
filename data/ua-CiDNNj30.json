This was a huge eye opener for me about all that goes into data science. They say you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know and I realize now that I don\u2019t know much at all.  I was really enjoying using SQL and Python to pull data down and \u201cplay\u201d with it but after watching this entire video I think I need to find something else to do. This course was so incredibly dense with theories, concepts and terminology that learning this just feels impossible to me. Maybe if I had taken collage level algebra, statistics and calculus this may have been a great refresher but without that prior knowledge, this just seems unattainable. I thought that data annalist roles are less intense than this but now I'm just not sure about anything. Regardless of my ability to understand this, the video is amazing and incredibly well done.

So why is 'data science' and big data so focused on coding, SQL etc. IMHO, there is massive confusion out there:  Data science and data analytics are just two different things, they are related but different. Think about it as Formula 1 car and F1 driver:  The data scientists are the engineers that build the car, the data analytics is the driver that uses the car (the data) to win races.  Yet, in the 'big data' world, people expect one single person to have engineering skills (data management, database creation) AND piloting skills (analytics) whereas in the F1 context that would be absurd: An engineer who helps build the F1 car and a F1 pilot have completely different skills and roles.

In contrast, if you enjoy cleaning and dissecting data, and optimizing company workflow with information being processed across several statistical measures, data science is more for you.\n\n\nBoth are algorithm and math heavy, the deeper you go.

It doesn't need to fit into some bucket. I don't like when you say your not doing data science because it doesn't fit in this bucket. This is like saying children aren't doing science and research because they haven't created a hypothesis or written a report. Considering sciences as meeting requirements is just like school that requires you to separate math, physics, and English into their own separate subjects. It is fine to teach the difference between the skills and I know that sometimes its important to see how they overlap as well. However, this isn't always practical and its actually more effective to have someone who has overlapping skills. Sometimes those skills are enough to even call that person a polymath. We shouldn't continue to teach things in isolation because that would create overspecialization. We are seeing overspecialization from people getting degrees from schools but unable to get good jobs with those skills. \n\nIt would be more productive to just say that it is an approach. Use that approach to design experiments using those approaches. Such as when you are playing a game like chess and you develop skills against one player.

There's still room for quantitatively-oriented people from many fields.\n\n\nAnd you're absolutely right that enormous progress is being made in machine-learning-as-a-service and that the work is becoming increasingly automated. But data science operates in a competitive environment: it's a question of whether you can get better insights faster than the other organizations. That often involves creating new algorithms, new applications, and bringing in new data. I believe that there will always be a need for people who can get insight from data and do something useful with it.\n\n\nBart", "likes": 16}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwBhHb-olqQQtyEvyN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-06-16T06:31:06Z", "author": "Sanyam Singh", "text": "please try to upload some basic projects of how data scientist do their work professionally in the industry it will literally help students to learn in real time.", "likes": 91}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwBhHb-olqQQtyEvyN4AaABAg.8wEBXtxfBGL94h4QXcpBQZ", "publishedAt": "2020-02-06T13:48:41Z", "author": "Parul Sahu", "text": "Yes That will be very helpful", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwBhHb-olqQQtyEvyN4AaABAg.8wEBXtxfBGL8whcgoo5nPg", "publishedAt": "2019-06-28T02:14:20Z", "author": "Sanyam Singh", "text": "@datalabcc all the jobs that are link to data uses python quite vast so working and practicing every attribute of  this language helpful and beneficial for all the novice students for instance we know how to manipulate basic data set with some python commands but we dont know all the working stages of data scientist or data analyst in the real time industry and how a project is to be done and what possible outcomes does the industry make after when a data scientist completed  their job on a given data set and what makes them worth to earn  thousands of money believe me this gonna work like a big motivation for the students.all in all let me give an example take basic data set like uci-iris and do all the necessary work on it  upto maximum extent and what possible results comes out from this especially what we looking in it and why and how to make final report of any particular data set after completing it and what decision could be made when the company manager sees it.", "likes": 9}, {"id": "UgwBhHb-olqQQtyEvyN4AaABAg.8wEBXtxfBGL8weU6DWFi-B", "publishedAt": "2019-06-26T20:52:50Z", "author": "datalabcc", "text": "A fully-worked example project would be wonderful.
