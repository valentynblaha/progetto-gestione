And to master Git, it's essential to have a thorough understanding of how branches work. In this course, we'll look at the many actions you can perform around branches - from creating and deleting them all the way to publishing, renaming, and comparing them.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f This course was created by Tobias G\u00fcnther from Tower. Tower creates a powerful Git desktop GUI for Mac and Windows. You can download it here: https://www.git-tower.com\n\nNote: This course focuses on using Git with the command line. You do NOT need Tower or any other GUI software to follow along.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (00:00) Introduction\n\u2328\ufe0f (00:46) Hosted by Tower\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:27) Branches as a core concept in Git\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:51) Core concepts: the HEAD branch\n\u2328\ufe0f (02:25) Core concepts: local vs. remote branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (03:04) Creating new branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (05:21) Switching branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (07:26) Renaming branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (10:29) Publishing branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (12:10) Tracking branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (17:25) Pulling + pushing branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (20:22) Deleting branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (24:15) Merging branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (26:52) Rebasing branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (30:20) Comparing branches\n\u2328\ufe0f (32:30) Working with Branches Cheat Sheet: a handy resource for your daily work, free to download (www.bit.ly/git-branches-cheatsheet)\n\n--\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\n\ud83d\udc7e Wong Voon jinq\n\ud83d\udc7e hexploitation\n\ud83d\udc7e Katia Moran\n\ud83d\udc7e BlckPhantom\n\ud83d\udc7e Nick Raker\n\ud83d\udc7e Otis Morgan\n\ud83d\udc7e DeezMaster\n\ud83d\udc7e Treehouse\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT33M20S", "likes": "4574", "views": "145866"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Louis Marie Atoluko Ayariga", "text": "Can there be conflicts when merging branches and how do we deal with the conflicts if they may come up?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u6797\u6e05\u6600", "text": "It is really easy to understand with clear and straightforward examples. \nThanks for your great effort! \ud83d\ude01", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "StellarStoic", "text": "The course is great but never get to manage to get a cheatsheet.
