Trailing Commas can be a blessing depending on your preference. Say you have created an array with trailing commas and newlines:\n\nconst array = [\n    1,\n    2,\n    3,\n]\n\nSuppose you had to add an element to this array on a later revision, it is easier to start editing beginning with an enter press and end with a comma than vise-versa (at least for me). But the real benefit comes from when you have to remove an element from the end. You can achieve that with a single keyboard shortcut via your editor without having to do extra work for clearing a comma from above line.
