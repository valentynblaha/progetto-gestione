Why do you use Generic type parameter TItem and don't use typeof(TItem)? Element at [0] can be one of the derived types and have additional fields.\n3:57:00 Actually this is only part of true. Since C# runtime can't detect, what's currently changed (We does not implement ''INotifyPropertyChanged\", we use List instead of \"ObservableCollection\"), blazor will trigger Child component rerendering if any callback in your parent component is called and it passes ANY parameter to your component, because it can change anything.\n4:57:57 It seems the reason for it is to show, that dispatcher is the place that handles all state changes no matter who sent this action. It can be any external action from some service, not only from view.\n5:16:10 What? This is not how C# works. Nothing prevents framework from Disposing component, it will be disposed normally. The issue here is that scoped component stores a reference to short-lived component and it will prevent component from being GC-ed. So, it will lead to memory leak.\n5:29:29 Wrong wrong wrong. It's not the reason why you won't implement a finalizer with unsubscription. It will not work as expected. Dispatcher will have reference to this store, so it will prevent store to be GC'ed untill Dispatcher is alive. Finalize will be called AFTER object is GC'ed, so it's useless and not works as expected.
