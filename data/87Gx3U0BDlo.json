Around the 5-6 min mark you are talking about creating a variable \"soup\" to store the object information in. \"Soup\" is an object being instantiated from the BeautifulSoup class itself and is not a variable. Also you mention that  \"find_all\" is a method to the BeautifulSoup object above which is a class not an object. You do correctly reference \"soup\" as an object after the fact but I only wanted to point this out as it may be confusing for some viewers. I find its important to use the terminology correctly to help those learning to understand what is going on, and when we mix things up when making these videos, it can often lead to confusion. I wont pick apart the whole video, but just wanted to point out a couple of the early things I noticed. To me its like calling a method a function even though they are similar they are not the same. Please don't get upset over me pointing this out. I just want to help make the terminology consistent with what is going on so you can make more accurate videos for those learning off of these in the future.
