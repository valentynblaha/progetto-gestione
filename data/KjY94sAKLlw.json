We'll also learn how to deploy the App using Vercel and to sync up GitHub with Vercel so we deploy the app automatically. \n\nNext is the React Framework for production. It makes building Apps, small or large, a lot easier. It has many features out of the box that you can use that will save loads of time. \n\n\ud83d\udcdd Database: https://github.com/timeToCode-ali/nextjs-tutorial/blob/main/data/data.json \n\n\ud83d\udcbb Source Code: https://github.com/timeToCode-ali/nextjs-tutorial \n\nCourse from Alicia Rodriguez .
