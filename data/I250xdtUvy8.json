Any suggestions on what to look at first? \n//\nThe FOSS guys have done a pretty good job, since the 90's, but, it still needs some work. I think the donation model would support projects, IF, the code was able to compete with the big money guys, AND the aesthetics were to continue to improve. The marketing aspect, including website design, needs to be brought up to standard, as well.  \n//\nBlender is killin it, GIMP is doing pretty good, Krita, dark table, etc... tag spaces looks like a contender. We need mobile support, api integration, and a few other things. There's no reason, with the talent emerging, that the big dogs shouldn't have some tough competition, if not beat at their own game. With the latest shenanigans by Adobe, with their pay wall and threats of pursuing intellectual rights litigation against their customer base, there seems to be a lot of pissed off people out there looking for a new home.\n//\nIf I'm able to, I'd definitely like to jump in, head first and contribute.
