Regarding the community thing, you forgot to mention one thing: *_contribute_* . This contribution can be in form of answering question, evaluating courses and report for errors, or sharing your code to the community via github. It is a cyclical process, someone answering your question, and in turn you should answer other question, if you are able to. And do not forget the Feynman Method: The best way to learn is by teaching it. Once you are able to explain or answer others question, your understanding is cemented in your mind. This also will build the community better.\r\n\r\n2. Its also better to include how to audit courses on Youtube. Sometimes videos in YT channels such as in freeCodeCamp channel is hours long and sometimes cannot be finished in one sitting. Fortunately, FCC provided timestamps so that we can return to our learning later. But the problem is how to manage your study if it is not structured like MOOCs, but rather just a pile of YT videos? I found that that theme is worth explaining too, and besides, you uploaded this video in FCC right? Lol \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.\n\nThank you for your amazing video, Seth and Sam! I think it is really an introductory course on learning online, which is as you described really different with in-class learning. I myself currently doing a masters, my topic is in e-learning and edtech (my research topic is in Self-Regulated Learning, which you guys amazingly covered, ten thumbs up for you guys \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d).

People who don't need to be spoon-fed, are generally self employed and as such we study only what is required, when it is required, for a specific purpose. We deliver projects and move on. We don't have time of the need to wave around tons of certificates and qualifications in the hopes that we impress somebody, who might employ us. PS: Generally we aren't impressed by stacks of paper either. We want to know; What projects did you do, what was your stake in the project, what was the flight plan and did you deliver ahead of schedule, on time or past the deployment date? If you went past the employment date, why? What roadblocks did you experience and what did you do to get around it. We know not all projects can be landed bang-on-time, in fact in the current world situation, they very seldom do. How you navigated your road to completion is way more important. Now tell me, in which set structure of learning do you have to deal with these variables? That my friend is why we do not care. PS: I never said I don't have any formal qualifications from an accredited University. I said employers do not care what your qualifications are if you can do the job.
