I think it's more helpful to think about what you can build with a language.  Learning Kotlin can enable you to build a variety of things that likely have different demand in the job market.   If you learn to build Android apps with Kotlin there are many jobs out there.  Writing backend code with Kotlin could help find a job as well.  I'd encourage you to think of what types of projects you want to work on, then determine if Kotlin is a viable tool for that project.  If it is, and there's a demand for that work in the job market, then Kotlin would definitely be a positive step towards landing a job.", "likes": 2}, {"id": "UgyG3BcE0gVjr0tPl994AaABAg.9232p62U-Ct927PVSF4qwi", "publishedAt": "2019-12-04T14:58:10Z", "author": "goobar", "text": "\ud83d\ude00  Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz38C8235KDQjWq1RV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-02T10:29:01Z", "author": "Now you know", "text": "0:50", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwIMNuHyYH7ts_tXhB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-01T23:16:12Z", "author": "Jose V.", "text": "Nice video man.
