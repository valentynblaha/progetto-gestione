All you need to do is go into the top right of the inspect panel, there should be two gears click on the lower gear for setting and select \"preserve log\", this will stop the console from refreshing. \n\nThe final error I got is at 1:45:13 and says \"params is not defined\", for whatever reason you can't reference params like that anymore and idk how to get around it without making the component a function. The alternative solution is to grab the url in the search bar and snag the id that way. In edit-exercise.component.js go to componentDidMount() at the top paste \"const arr = window.location.href.split('/');\" This creates an array consisting of every step in the url path of our current page. Then in the axios.get() call replace this.props.match.params.id with \"arr[arr.length-1]\". This gets the last element of our array which happens to be the id of the exercise that we are editing. The ID is what we need to make correct calls to MongoDB. Do the same thing for the onSubmit function in the same file.\n\n(The final solution is not saleable, the more branching paths there are in the url, the harder it will be to maintain.

I have formal training in teaching (doesn't pay though which is why I'm here lol) and this method is actually a bit counter-intuitive, as students will be inadvertedly focusing more on the code itself than the concepts they're supposed to be learning in relation to the code - it's just an unecessary amount to keep track of. If it's just for watching then it's fine but still doable, but for coding along, it's pretty counter-productive. Going line by line also forces the instructor to explain the code more thoroughly.\n\nAs for syntax, this still applies even if they already know the syntax since it's not the syntax that's the problem, just the amount of information presented at one time. This is because it actually has more to do with muscle memory than rote memorization, and spaced repitition and introduction to newer concepts is easier with smaller chunks rather than larger ones; it's just how we generally learn. It's also why chunking is such a popular technique for memorization, which is kind of difficult to do with the examples in this video. I know it was just your opinion, but it's something a lot of coding instructors do really need to improve upon. If you have no problems with pasting code, that's fine too, but I think if enough people complain about it, it's certainly a problem worth addressing.

What I did was create the database locally in database.js using mongoose.connection.once then put it inside a function. Exported that function and required it in the users.model.js file.

Kept all the schema the same inside the model file and then exported the model. Then when you require the model from users.model.js in the users.js routing file it should work fine.
