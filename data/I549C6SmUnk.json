L\u00d6VE is a framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS. In this course, you will first learn how to program in Lua. Then you will learn how to use Love2D with Lua to develop amazing games.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Steve.
