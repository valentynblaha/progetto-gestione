{"video": {"id": "CseCDFed458", "title": "The History of JavaScript: a timeline of programming language evolution over the past 20 years", "description": "From the early days of the wild wild web, JavaScript has been there. Its evolved from a simple two week hack into a vibrant ecosystem that is continuously evolving to the modern web.\n\nJoin Matt as he walks the timeline of JavaScripts evolution from where it began into what it has become today. If you are new to web development or just getting back into development or coming to web development from a different part of the stack this is for you. Matt will showcase several demo apps that highlight the differences in how web apps used to be built with ES5 and highlight the tools that have changed how they are built for the modern web and ES6. Finally he will show how that same app can be built with Angular, one of the many modern frameworks that helps engineers build responsive and performant web applications.\n\nTalk given by Matt Hippely at the JavaScriptLA meetup.\n\nThanks to JavaScriptLA for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.

These front-end frameworks seem to have been built with no thought to entry-level developers, they're just layer upon layer upon layer upon layer of poorly explained complexity intended to solve problems that most developers are never going to encounter.
