This project was inspired by the classic carnival/arcade style shooting gallery games! Learn to build the entire project from scratch using Python and the PyGame framework. We start by setting up PyGame, and drawing static images on the screen. Then we animate tiers of procedurally drawn enemies onto each level and get them moving, then check to see if the player has shot them. Once the player clears a full level of enemies, they proceed to the next level. Then we create pause functionality, a main menu and game over conditions.\n\nWe store the high scores in an external text file that we read in from when the game boots up and write to it any time there is a new high score during gameplay.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Created by Pete LeMaster.

Eg., in 1:46:00 while before you used a definition of a rectangle to create a button, here you are doing so by defining an area on the screen (which remains there even when no longer active). Sometimes you point out your approach differs because of preference or convenience, but the reasoning is not always made clear. Since this is aimed at beginner levels, a certain level of dicipline in this is required.\nEven for me, a somewhat experienced coder, it is not immediately clear why you used event.type MOUSEBUTTONDOWN for one situation and mouse.get_pressed() in the next. Just another instance of preference or was there an actual reason behind it. I find this inconsistency a bit sloppy.\nTo answer your question why you should bring in variables as parameters rather than through globals in such a project: to train some dicipline for when you are working in larger projects. A smaller project should not just be about 'getting it to work', but as a demonstration of the principles used in real projects.", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzNXtl3Dptl2W9qSHx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-11-30T13:57:21Z", "author": "JasonRobards2", "text": "Great tutorial!
