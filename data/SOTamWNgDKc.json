Allocate 120 minutes. Actual exam is 90 minutes.\n2. 50 scored questions and 15 unscored (too hard / too easy / unseen)\n3. Always create IAM user instead of using root account. IAM user common policies are Admin, PowerUsers, etc\n4. General computing : EC2. GPU Computing : Infer1. (compete against tpu in gcp). Quantum: AWS Bracket.\n5. Data centers within a region are isolate from each other (different buildings), but close enough to provide low latency (< 10ms), therefore they usually have the same impact, and HA is defined as being available in 2/3 different AZs. Subnets are associated with AZs. You pick subnets instead of picking AZs for EC2, for instance. Default subnets are created one subnet per AZ. Managed HA services will replicate in multiple AZs behind the scene in each region so you don't need to pick (e.g., S3.). CloudFront distribution uses \"area\" which covers many regions. Global services like IAM doesn't even have concept of region.\n6. Fault Domain: isolated physical construct where failure / fault will not impact other fault domains. Fault level: A collection of fault domains. Fault Domains can be nested.\n\nNetwork:\n1. AWS Global Network: interconnections between AWS Global Infrastructure. Commonly referred to as \"the backbone of AWS\". It's private networks, where things can move very fast/consistent/reliable/secure without internet topology disruptions between data centers. \n    A. Edge Locations: on and off ramps to the AWS Global Network. \n    B. AWS Global Accelerator : Use edge locations as on-ramps to quickly reach AWS resources by traversing the fast Global Network. One great use case is when you deploy your web application in one region, and you can use AWS global accelerator to boost your response time globally.\n    C. Amazon CloudFront (CDN): Uses edge locations as an off-ramp to provide at the edge storage and compute near the end user\n    D. VPC endpoints: Ensuring your resources stay within AWS network and do not traverse over the public internet.\n2. PoP: data center for content delivery or expedited upload. \n    A. Edge locations: holds cached copy of the popular files\n    B. Regional Edge Locations: hold large cache of less-popular files to reduce full round trip and reduce cost of transfer fees.\n3. AWS Direct Connect: Private / Dedicated connection that provides private, consistent and reliable network between your on-prem data center to the AWS Cloud.\n4. Local Zones (Opt-in feature): data centers close to densely populated area to provide single-digit millisecond low latency performance for that area. The identifier looks like us-west-2-lax--1a. Only certain services are available.\n5. Wavelength Zones: ultra low latency edge-computing on 5G networks. (e.g., deploy Ec2 instance to hardware in a 5G networks.)\n\nCompliance & Policy (& Permissions):\n1. Data Residency: The physical location where the servers and data reside for an organization.\n2. Compliance Boundaries: Regulatory compliance / legal rules by a government that describes where data and services are allowed to reside.\n3. Data Sovereignity: legal authority / juristic control asserted on data within juristic boundaries.\n4. AWS Config: Policy as Code service. You can create rules that continuous check AWS resource configuration. If they deviate (someone accidentally deploy to a wrong region), you can get alerted / the service can auto-fix the deviation.\n5. IAM policies: role/group - level permissions that directly deny access to certain things. Service Control Policy (SCP) on the other hand manages permissions organization/account-wide.\n6. Gov Cloud: special regions for public sectors\n\nDisaster Recover Options:\n1. Back up & Restore: Hours\n2. Pilot light(data is replicated with minimal services running) : 10 min\n3. Warm Standby (Scaled down copy of infra ready to scale up): min\n4. Hot standby (multi-site active/active, basically double the cost, scaled up copy): real-time\n\nAWS Account ID: globally unique, 12 digits, assigned for every user \n(root and non-root IAM users), can be associated with alias,  can assume cross-account roles, or assume principals in policies, to access resources under other accounts (ownerID is another account).\n\nARN: AWS Resource Names uniquely identify AWS resources. Unambiguously specify a resource across all of AWS.\narn:<partition>:<service>:<region>:<account-id>:<resource-id>\narn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id\narn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id\n\nwhere partition can be aws, aws-cn, aws-us-gov.\n\nSince ARN address is hierarchical, you can use * to specify a group of resources in policies, etc: arn:partition:service:region:account-id:*\n\nIAC:\nCloudFormation (CFN): JSON/YAML, declarative, can be huge and not as dynamic (hard to create repeated infra). The infra CFN creates is called stack.\nCDK: Imperative, web programming language e.g., Python, can be more dynamic, generates CFN. Easier to create CICD pipelines than CFN. AWS CDK vs. AWS SDK? AWS CDK ensures idempotence of your infrastructure.\nCDK constructs: reusable cloud components. constructs.dev (similar to Terraform modules).\n\nEC2: virtual machines. \"instance\". \nAMI: predefined configuration for EC2 - amount of CPU, amount of memory, network bandwidth, OS, storage options such as EBS.\nEC2 is considered the backbone of AWS as many services use EC2 as underlying servers -- S3, RDS, DDB, Lambdas, etc", "likes": 75}, "replies": [{"author": "Gaurang Gupta", "text": "Hijacking top comment because it makes it easy to navigate.

Assim a sucess\u00e3o ao trono, deixava de existir pela aus\u00eancia de filhos. No reinado, por\u00e9m, um m\u00e9dico crist\u00e3o e considerado praticante e seguidor do evangelho, convenceu a fam\u00edlia do rei, que era considerado ateu, a se converter ao cristianismo, o m\u00e9dico sugeriu que fizessem um pedido a Jesus Cristo para lhes fazer um milagre de se tornarem pais. A gra\u00e7a da convers\u00e3o e generosidade de Deus a essa fam\u00edlia foi a chegada de um beb\u00ea, menina que nasceu em 10 de agosto sob intensa alegria e admira\u00e7\u00e3o da m\u00e3e e pai que exultavam o milagre. O nome dado a menina foi LUMENA. O significado desse nome \u00e9 \u201cLuz da F\u00e9\u201d. Realmente tinha sido uma luz na vida do casal. Na sequ\u00eancia dos fatos, chegou o dia do batismo da Lumena. E o nome FILO foi acrescentado a Lumena, se tornando FILOMENA.\n\nA vida e o cora\u00e7\u00e3o daquela menina que ficou sabendo de sua hist\u00f3ria de vida, a levou para uma decis\u00e3o \u00edntima como mulher. Fez seus votos de castidade e se declarou como \u201cesposa de Jesus\u201d. Assim desde pequena j\u00e1 havia decidido a sua vida. Quando aos 13 anos, mocinha bonita e atraente, passou pelo maior desafio de sua vida ao n\u00e3o atender um pedido de seus pais. O Imperador Deocleciano tomava conta daquela regi\u00e3o onde seus pais moravam. E uma guerra foi declarada pelo imperador, o que acabaria com os moradores e bens dos pais da Filomena. Ao saber da decis\u00e3o do imperador, o pai da jovem Filomena, acompanhado por ela e de sua esposa, foram a Roma para falar pessoalmente com Deocleciano. Queria pedir a paz e evitar a guerra.\n\nNo pal\u00e1cio do imperador aconteceu o fato que mudaria a hist\u00f3ria e o futuro da mo\u00e7a Filomena. Quando seus pais estavam com o imperador, ele a viu e ficou deslumbrado com a beleza da jovem. Imediatamente se dirigiu aos seus pais e a pediu em casamento. Devido as circunst\u00e2ncias do momento e desejando uma un\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1vel \u00e0 filha, consentiram de imediato. S\u00f3 que a pr\u00f3pria Filomena n\u00e3o aceitou tal proposta que viria em sentido contr\u00e1rio a sua decis\u00e3o de castidade. Ela se dizia comprometida com Jesus, seu Divino Esposo.\n\nContrariado, o Imperador Deocleciano a mandou para o c\u00e1rcere e puni-la pela desobedi\u00eancia ao seu pedido. Filomena foi presa e torturada. Durante 37 dias sua vida sofreu grandes tormentos, representados em sua imagem por alguns dos \u00edcones como a \u00e2ncora. A hist\u00f3ria de Santa Filomena teve momentos dif\u00edceis de serem descritos. Mas tamb\u00e9m aconteceram verdadeiros milagres, como a apari\u00e7\u00e3o de Nossa Senhora a ela, curando-a de suas chagas sofridas no c\u00e1rcere. A M\u00e3e de Jesus lhe disse que ela sofreria mais alguns dias, e depois seu Filho Jesus a levaria ao c\u00e9u. Um dos fatos descritos pelos estudiosos da vida de Santa Filomena, \u00e9 que at\u00e9 o carrasco que a martirizou se converteu ao cristianismo.\n\nO \u00f3dio do Imperador era tanto que mandou flech\u00e1-la, mas n\u00e3o a acertaram; pensando ser os deuses dela que as desviavam. Ele mandou aquecer as flechas no fogo e atirar nela, mas as flechas com suas pontas quentes, no lugar de acertar voltaram para tr\u00e1s e mataram seis flecheiros. Depois de derrotado com este prod\u00edgio de Deus salvando Filomena, o Imperador mandou jog\u00e1-la no rio Tibre com uma \u00e2ncora ao pesco\u00e7o; veio um anjo e cortou a corda, a \u00e2ncora foi para o fundo, onde se encontra at\u00e9 hoje, e Ela nem sequer molhou o vestido.\n\nA multid\u00e3o que presenciava estes prod\u00edgios se convertia ao cristianismo e glorificava a Deus. Ent\u00e3o o imperador tirano n\u00e3o suportando mais a sua c\u00f3lera deu ordens para que fosse decapitada.\n\nAssim a alma de Filomena voou gloriosamente para o c\u00e9u, no dia 10 de agosto, numa sexta-feira, \u00e0s tr\u00eas horas da tarde, como seu Divino Esposo Jesus tamb\u00e9m passou nessa hora pelo sacrif\u00edcio da cruz.\nO corpo de Santa Filomena s\u00f3 foi encontrado nas escava\u00e7\u00f5es das catacumbas de Priscila, em Roma, no dia 25 de maio de 1802. A sepultura estava intacta, fato realmente rar\u00edssimo, e foi aberta na presen\u00e7a de autoridades civis, religiosos da Igreja e peritos leigos. Durante as escava\u00e7\u00f5es, ainda encontraram: tr\u00eas placas de terracota, com as seguintes inscri\u00e7\u00f5es: \u201cPax te Cum Fi Lumena\u201d, ou seja \u201cA paz esteja contigo, Filomena\u201d.\n\nO caix\u00e3o tinha os entalhes de uma palma, tr\u00eas flechas, uma \u00e2ncora, um chicote e um l\u00edrio, indicando a forma de seu mart\u00edrio e morte. Dentro dele estavam as rel\u00edquias do corpo de uma jovem e um pequeno frasco com um l\u00edquido vermelho ressequido. Os peritos verificaram que o corpo era de uma jovem com cerca de treze anos de idade, que tinha o cr\u00e2nio fraturado e que teria vivido no s\u00e9culo IV. Assim, finalmente, foram encontradas as rel\u00edquias da jovem m\u00e1rtir Santa Filomena, que ficaram sob os cuidados da Igreja Cat\u00f3lica.\nEssas rel\u00edquias foram transferidas para a Igreja de Nossa Senhora das Gra\u00e7as, em N\u00e1poles, onde muitas gra\u00e7as e milagres foram alcan\u00e7ados por intercess\u00e3o da Santa, bem como ocorreram em muitas outras partes do mundo crist\u00e3o. O seu santu\u00e1rio tornou-se um centro de intensa e frequente peregrina\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nMuitos pont\u00edfices declararam-se fi\u00e9is devotos de Santa Filomena, entre eles o Papa Le\u00e3o XII, que a proclamou \u201ca grande milagrosa do s\u00e9culo XIX\u201d. Foi o papa Greg\u00f3rio XVI que a nomeou \u201cPadroeira do Ros\u00e1rio Vivente\u201d e escolheu o dia 10 de agosto para a sua festa.\n\nEsse relato est\u00e1 no livro \u201cRevela\u00e7\u00f5es\u201d, de madre Maria Luiza de Jesus, fundadora da Ordem Religiosa das Irm\u00e3s da Imaculada e de Santa Filomena e tamb\u00e9m consta da hist\u00f3ria citada no livro \u201cAmigos de Santa Filomena\u201d.\n\nARQUIDIOCESE DE SOROCABA\n\nCopyright Santu\u00e1rio Santa Filomena.\nFeito com  por \nPt Portugu\u00eas", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "XGene", "text": "Bookmark 32:17", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ali Asger Habib", "text": "17:49", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Soumya Shivananjegowda", "text": "Thank you for making such a long sequence video comprising all possible concepts for CCP level.

No dia do ju\u00edzo final, Eu darei uma eternidade feliz \u00e0queles que, por amor e com reconhecimento Me tenham oferecido todos os dias \u201cos merecimentos\u201d de Meus sofrimentos secretos, completando a oferta com a Ora\u00e7\u00e3o de Louvor e Repara\u00e7\u00e3o que se segue:\nMeu Senhor e meu Deus! \u00c9 minha vontade irrevog\u00e1vel honrar-Vos, louvar-Vos e adorar-Vos por todas as Vossas dores secretas e pelo derramamento do Vosso Sangue.\nQuanto gr\u00e3os de areia haja no mar, gr\u00e3os de terra nos campos, rebentos de erva em toda a terra, frutos nas \u00e1rvores, folhas nos ramos, flores nos campos, estrelas no firmamento, Anjos no C\u00e9u e criaturas sobre a terra, tantos milhares de vezes sejam adorados e glorificados o Senhor Jesus Cristo, o Seu Sant\u00edssimo Cora\u00e7\u00e3o, o Seu precios\u00edssimo Sangue, o Sacrif\u00edcio divino da Santa Missa e o Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento do Altar.\nSejam louvados e glorificados a Sant\u00edssima Virgem Maria, os nove coros gloriosos dos Anjos e a multid\u00e3o dos Santos, por mim e por todos os homens, agora e por toda eternidade.\nTantas vezes eu desejo, meu bem amado Jesus, agradecer-Vos, servir-Vos e agradar-Vos, reparar todos os ultrajes que vos s\u00e3o feitos e pertencer-vos de corpo e alma.\nQuero muitas vezes arrepender-me dos meus pecados e pedir-Vos, \u00f3 meu Deus, perd\u00e3o e miseric\u00f3rdia.\nQuero tamb\u00e9m oferecer a Deus Pai os Vossos m\u00e9ritos infinitos, em repara\u00e7\u00e3o das minhas faltas e dos meus pecados, e pelos meus t\u00e3o merecidos castigos. Estou firmemente decidido a mudar de vida e pe\u00e7o-Vos que, \u00e0 hora da minha morte, me sinta feliz e em paz.\nQuero tamb\u00e9m rezar pela liberta\u00e7\u00e3o das pobres almas do Purgat\u00f3rio. Desejo renovar fielmente este louvor de repara\u00e7\u00e3o e amor em cada hora do dia e da noite, at\u00e9 ao \u00faltimo instante da minha vida.\nPe\u00e7o-Vos, meu bom e amabil\u00edssimo Jesus, que confirmeis no C\u00e9u este meu sincero desejo.
