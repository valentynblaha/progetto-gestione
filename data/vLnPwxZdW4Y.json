The presentation in general does not look professional. With regard to the content, I've watch 3 other C++ tutorials to get as much content as possible, and this is by far the weakest exposition of the language. The delivery of the course by this young man is amateur at best. I did not love his delivery IMHO. I felt a bit too off the cuff and imprecise.

Another thing before we go in depth is that a \"for\" loop is basically a steroid while loop + if statement. the variable I is just a place holder. It's saying that when i is equal to pownum, stop multiplying result by itself x basenum. For example lets use values. basenum = 2, and pownum is 3. (8 Is The Answer).  for i = 0; i++ (due to the increment at the end of the for statement) < pownum; increment. Summary: i is just a placeholder so that WHEN we reach the value of pownum we stop. for i = 0, i < pownum; increment. Entering the loop --> result (previously basenum x basenum or at the start, 1) = itself (result) * basenum (2). 2 = 2*2 (Not comparison operator but assignment.) Both of your bullet points are incorrect. Continue looping as long (the placeholder) i is less than the powNum. Languages don't have a \"when\" statement, so in place they use a for.

It isn\u2019t necessary that it is ever printed on paper.\r\n\r\nFor some planning, white boards work just fine, but I\u2019ve gotten in the habit of pulling out my phone and getting a picture of the final result of any white board planning sessions. In a day or two, I will have forgotten some of the details. In a week, I\u2019ll remember some piece of it completely different from what was discussed.\r\n\r\nPlanning helps you to do three things. First, you determine what decisions need to be made. Second, you consider the options. Third, you consider the impact that the various choices have on each other.\r\n\r\nBasically, now I'm coding with C++ and i wanted to program a OOP system. I stucked when I code without a plan/diagram and then I draw a simple diagram then coding was getting easier.\r\n\r\nThis is how I developed amazing OOP and file handling travel management system with C++: https://youtu.be/viSEf6o0ibs\r\nI hope this article and video will help to you guys!!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Thi\u00ean Ph\u00fac Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u1ea1m", "text": "so basically the lecture in c++ is kinda the same that in C ( mad libs game ,etc)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pablo Koren", "text": "i was watching the video on 2x speed so it took me only 2 hours.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "santhosh C", "text": "Finally I was finished in this video full.

Thank you", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "From the ISO C++ FAQ:\n \nShould I use using namespace std in my code?\n \n\"Probably not.\n\nPeople don\u2019t like typing std:: over and over, and they discover that using namespace std lets the compiler see any std name, even if unqualified. The fly in that ointment is that it lets the compiler see any std name, even the ones you didn\u2019t think about. In other words, it can create name conflicts and ambiguities.\n\nFor example, suppose your code is counting things and you happen to use a variable or function named count. But the std library also uses the name count (it\u2019s one of the std algorithms), which could cause ambiguities.\n\nLook, the whole point of namespaces is to prevent namespace collisions between two independently developed piles of code. The using-directive (that\u2019s the technical name for using namespace XYZ) effectively dumps one namespace into another, which can subvert that goal. The using-directive exists for legacy C++ code and to ease the transition to namespaces, but you probably shouldn\u2019t use it on a regular basis, at least not in your new C++ code.\n\nIf you really want to avoid typing std::, then you can either use something else called a using-declaration, or get over it and just type std:: (the un-solution):\n\n- Use a using-declaration, which brings in specific, selected names. For example, to allow your code to use the name cout without a std:: qualifier, you could insert using std::cout into your code. This is unlikely to cause confusion or ambiguity because the names you bring in are explicit.\n\n#include <vector>\n#include <iostream>\nvoid f(const std::vector<double>& v)\n{\n using std::cout;  // \u2190 a using-declaration that lets you use cout without qualification\n cout << \"Values:\";\n for (auto value : v)\n   cout << ' ' << value;\n cout << '\\n';\n}\n\n- Get over it and just type std:: (the un-solution):\n\n#include <vector>\n#include <iostream>\nvoid f(const std::vector<double>& v)\n{\n std::cout << \"Values:\";\n for (auto value : v)\n   std::cout << ' ' << value;\n std::cout << '\\n';\n}\n\nI personally find it\u2019s faster to type \u201cstd::\u201d than to decide, for each distinct std name, whether or not to include a using-declaration and if so, to find the best scope and add it there. But either way is fine. Just remember that you are part of a team, so make sure you use an approach that is consistent with the rest of your organization.\"", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Apple YT", "text": "@Artem Katerynych why?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "Don't do using namespace std, it's bad practice.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Gisemba Mokua", "text": "Hello support, i am trying to learn but my code has an error.

For that, I would recommend the website learncpp.\n  \nWhen you're done with that, it's just a matter of how you want to make games. If you want to use a game engine, Unreal Engine is a pretty popular one. It's really powerful, and uses C++ for its scripts.\n  \nIf you want to make games from scratch, you have far more options. I would suggest you start small, and pick up a graphics library that handles everything for you. The industry standard library for simple graphics is SDL2. It handles things like window creation, 2D graphics rendering, keyboard and mouse, controller, and touch support, basic audio, basic logging, and much more. The core SDL library provides mostly just the bare essentials, but there are a few sub-libraries that extend its functionally. There's SDL_image for loading images from a variety of different file types, SDL_mixer for enhanced audio support, SDL_ttf for True Type Font support, and SDL_net for networking support. The nice thing about this is that if you don't like how SDL handles one thing, you can just swap that sub-library with another. Even some AAA games use SDL, most notably Valve. It's written in C, as most graphics libraries are, but has direct support for C++, so you'll have to get used to doing things the data ordinated way. Since you have to manage dynamic memory manually in C, you have to remember to wrap SDL types that require manual memory management in smart pointers as avoidable manual memory management is frowned upon in modern C++ (e.g. use std::unique_ptr<SDL_Window, decltype(&SDL_DestroyWindow)> instead of a plain SDL_Window *, so you wouldn't have to call SDL_DestroyWindow yourself). It's cross-platform, so you can easily port your game to different OSs and mobile.\n\nSDL: https://libsdl.org\nDocs: https://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory\n  \nAnother popular graphics library is SFML. It isn't as popular as SDL, and no AAA games use it, but it's frequently used by beginners. Unlike SDL, it comes as a single library, and is written in C++11. I've used both SDL and SFML, and I'm personally not a fan of SFML, but you can try both and see which one you prefer.\n  \nSFML: https://www.sfml-dev.org\nDocs: https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/\n  \nOnce you gain some experience in gamedev, you can move on to a graphics API that gives you complete control over the graphics and the GPU. A highly popular graphics API is OpenGL. It's cross-platform, and is probably the easiest to learn. It's only a graphics API, so you'll need to get a separate library for window creation, and even for loading the OpenGL functions and other symbols. Both SDL and SFML support OpenGL, so you can pair it with one of them if you'd like. You could also go with a platform-specific graphics API, like DirectX, which is only available on Windows.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "@\u305f\u308b lol Unity is written in C++, but it uses C# for scripting.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "\u305f\u308b", "text": "Search for unity or unreal game development in youtube, they use c++", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "itzzz_Swervo", "text": "31:40", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "itzzz_Swervo", "text": "I watched this video in 2x speed so it could take me 2 hours to watch the full vid", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\uc5c4\ub9c8\uc190\uc740 \uc57d\uc190\ub300\uacf5", "text": "#include <iostream>\n\nint main() \n{\n    std::cout << \"Thanks Mike!\\n\";\n    return 0;\n}", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "@Hassan Murtaza: TheAlpha313 what makes you say that?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Hassan Murtaza: TheAlpha313", "text": "You've written this code using Visual Studio I can guarantee.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sanyat", "text": "@37:13 true alpha male behaviour", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Gamer Extreme_0611", "text": "Bro there is a video in your ads", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Watashi", "text": "can i hack my bank with this?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "Yes.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "SkullEditz", "text": "roses are red\nsky is blue\ni didnt skipped any add\nbecause i want to support him too", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "akbarov", "text": "Great!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "U\u0274\u00edqX\u30c4", "text": "IM SO GLAD I FOUND THIS  VIDEO", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "nama anda", "text": "1:47", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Starbeek Beek", "text": "Me who doesn\u2019t even know HTML.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Starbeek Beek", "text": "Coming back to this video after 8 months and I haven't learnt anything since then.

In C++, you should never really be using raw arrays (C-style arrays, e.g. int arr[]) unless you\u2019re implementing your own data structure, or something like that. Instead, you should be using STL containers ( https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container ). The first one you should always consider is std::vector. std::vector is a container which stores elements contiguously, similar to raw arrays, and elements can be added and removed from it at any time.\n \ne.g.\n \n    // Creates a vector with three elements\n    std::vector<int> vec{1, 2, 3};\n    // Adds 4 to the back of the vector.\n    vec.emplace_back(4);\n    // Removes element \u201c2\u201d, by passing an iterator which points to that element to the erase member function.\n    vec.erase(vec.begin() + 1);\n\nIf the size of your array isn\u2019t going to change, and the size is known at compile-time, you should use std::array. std::array allocates its memory on the stack, and it\u2019s pretty much just a safer wrapper for raw stack arrays.\n \ne.g.\n \n    std::array<int, 3> arr{1, 2, 3};\n    for (int num : arr)\n        std::cout << num << \u2018\\n\u2019;\n\nHowever, since it allocates the memory on the stack, it may not be ideal if you\u2019re going to be storing a very massive amount of elements. In that case, you should use std::vector. If you\u2019re not going to add those elements immediately, you can pre-allocate the memory you\u2019ll eventually need using std::vector<T>::reserve or std::vector<T>::resize.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Richie Shambharkar", "text": "Can some please tell me which software he is using to code this ???", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "It\u2019s CodeBlocks, but you shouldn\u2019t really use it.

My understanding is very poor cuz I am just 15 so I don't understand stuff mentioned but I do get some of the advices like it was really stupid of me to write count instead of cout and also when I did some major mistakes", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "The main issues are that you\u2019re missing a << before std::endl in your first std::cout statement, and in your last std::cout statement, you have a << at the end but nothing after it. You\u2019re also using std::string, but you never included the header file that contains its declaration, so you need to include <string>.\n  \nBut there\u2019s also a bunch of other things that you should change:\n  \n- Don\u2019t do using namespace std, it\u2019s bad practice. Since everything in the standard library is defined within the std namespace, you need to prefix all standard library symbols with std::.\n \ne.g.\n \n    std::cout << \u201cHello, world!\\n\u201d;\n \n- Since you are only viewing the contents of the string, and not using any features that std::string provides, you should just use std::string_view from <string_view> instead. std::string_view was added in C++17, so make sure you set your C++ standard to that. Compared to std::string, there\u2019s not much you can do with it; as it\u2019s name implies, it\u2019s just used to view the contents of a string. The nice thing about it is that it doesn\u2019t allocate the memory for the string, so it is a bit faster than std::string. This also means that the string must actually exist while you\u2019re viewing it, so make sure that the string data never gets freed while you still need it (not that this can happen in your code, just thought you should know this).\n \n- If a variable isn\u2019t going to change, and it can be evaluated at compile-time, make it constexpr. Otherwise, make it const.\n \n- Almost always use uniform initialization, with { }, instead of copy initialization, with =, or the old-school direct initialization, with ( ), as uniform initialization is much safer and avoid the most vexing parse. \n \n e.g.\n  \n    int i{8};\n    int *ptr{&i};\n    std::string_view str{\u201cHello, World\u201d};\n    std::string_view &ref{str};\n \nWhen you initialize a fundamental type with { }, it does not allow implicit narrowing conversions. For example, this means that you can initialize a double by passing it a float, but you can\u2019t initialize a float by passing it a double, since a double is twice the size of a float, so a float can\u2019t hold its value. If for some reason you still want to pass the value of a larger type to a smaller type, you\u2019ll have to explicitly cast it, using static_cast, although you may lose some data.\n \ne.g.\n \n    float f1{64.0};\n    double d1{f1}; // Ok.\n    \n    double d2{80.0};\n    float f2{d2}; // Error, implicit narrowing not allowed.\n    float f3{static_cast<float>(d2)}; // Ok, but preferably should be avoided.\n  \nAs previously mentioned, uniform initialization also avoids the most vexing parse. For instance, consider the following line of code:\n \n    Foo foo(Foo());\n \nA novice may assume that that line is declaring an object of type Foo by copying a temporary Foo object into its constructor. In actuality, that line is a function declaration named foo, which returns a copy of Foo and takes in an unnamed parameter of type Foo by value. This is how all C++ compilers are required to interpret it. However, take a look at this line:\n  \n    Foo foo{Foo{}};\n \nThis line actually defines a variable of type Foo. Another nice thing about uniform initialization is that it doesn\u2019t require you to specify the type all the time. For example,\n \n    struct Point final\n    {\n        int x, y;\n    };\n    \n    inline Point getLocation() noexcept\n    {\n        return {8, 5}; // equivalent to Point(8, 5) or Point{8, 5}.\n    }\n  \nThe only reason you may want to not use uniform initialization that I can think of is when you want to avoid calling a constructor that takes in an std::initializer_list object, as uniform initialization will always prefer those constructors. If you don\u2019t know what std::initializer_list is (not to be confused with constructor initializer lists, which are a completely different thing, but unfortunately have a very similar name), it is used to pass multiple values of the same type into an object. It is typically used with container types, like std::array and std::vector. You can create an initializer_list using curly braces, similarly to how you would initialize raw arrays.\n \ne.g.\n \n    std::vector<int> vec{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   \nThat line is equivalent to\n    \n    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    \nor\n \n    std::vector<int> vec({1, 2, 3, 4, 5});\n \nor even\n \n    std::vector<int> vec{std::initializer_list{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}};\n \nstd::vector has a constructor that takes in a size_type n variable, which allocated enough memory for n amount of elements, and a constructor that takes in an std::initializer list. Since uniform initialization will always call a constructor that takes in an std::initializer_list, if one exists, this line:\n \n    std::vector<int> vec{5};\n \nwill create a vector with one element in it, an int with the value of five. If your intention was to allocate enough memory for five elements, you\u2019ll have to use the old style of initialization:\n \n    std::vector<int> vec(5);\n  \nFor this reason, container types are usually always initialized with ( ) unless you want to call the constructor that takes in an std::initializer_list.\n \n-If you need to flush the stream and end the line, use std::endl. If you just need to end the line, use \u2018\\n\u2019. Otherwise, you\u2019re wasting performance by flushing the stream, and it makes your intention less clear.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Colin Wooldridge", "text": "na man, im a vs boi", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Colin Wooldridge", "text": "you guys should totally try to make a 4 hour video on Visual Basic Script (vbs)", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Gabe", "text": "no", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "vaibhav pandey", "text": "watching this after 3 years just to revise the syntax", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Morshed Alam Chowdhury", "text": "this is really gonna help in my arduino projects and robotics class!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Elliot", "text": "do you know how to fix the error \"getline identifier not found\"", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Elliot", "text": "@Artem Katerynych thank you so much, great help", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "Include <string>, that\u2019s where the function declaration is found.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "ghettosagal", "text": "anyone else think he kinda foine?  \ud83d\udc40", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Zey Roax", "text": "I was going with C# but I was confused a bit in loops so I thought to learn it too a bit and when I came here so its a bit similar therefore easy for me!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Vijay Singh", "text": "stop going through comments,complete the tutorial", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Vijay Singh", "text": "@Zey Roax thanks for reply", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Zey Roax", "text": "an ad going so i am going through the comments", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "MacariaMae Pereyra", "text": "Me finishing the ads just to say thank you for saving my ass lmfaooo", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ramy Fili", "text": "1:29:47", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "AE", "text": "So this is for MAC and not Windows.

A namespace provides a named scope for your symbols.\n \ne.g.\n \n    namespace foo\n    {\n        void func() noexcept\n        {\n            std::cout << \u201cHello\\n\u201d;\n        }\n    }\n \n    namespace bar\n    {\n        void func() noexcept\n        {\n            std::cout << \u201cWorld\\n\u201d;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        foo::func(); // Prints \u201cHello\u201d.\n        bar::func(); // Prints \u201cWorld\u201d.\n        func(); // Error, no global function \u201cfunc\u201d exists.\n    \n        return 0;\n    }\n \nEverything in the standard library is defined inside the std namespace. As such, all symbols that you use from the standard library must be prefixed with std::. This does *not* mean you have to also prefix the core language components with it. So the correct way to write that program would be:\n \n    int main()\n    {\n        std::cout << \u201cHello world\\n\u201d;\n        return 0;\n    }\n  \nThe using namespace declaration makes it so that the compiler treats all symbols defined in the given namespace as if they were defined in the global namespace. This can result in a multitude of issues, like name collisions, which is when you have two or more symbols with the same name, and the compiler is not sure which one it should use, or the linker isn\u2019t sure which one to link, etc. By prefixing every symbol with their namespace name, it also makes it clear where everything is from.", "likes": 2}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "- You misspelled characterAge\n \n- There is no need to declare the variable on one line, but give it a value on the next line. Just give it a value immediately.\n \ne.g.\n \n    int characterAge{17};\n  \n- Prefer uniform initialization, with { }, over other forms of initialization, like = or ( ), as uniform initialization is much safer and avoids the most vexing parse.\n \n- Don\u2019t do using namespace std as it is widely considered to be bad practice.\n \n- Always include the header files you need; don\u2019t rely on other header files including the files you need (unless the entire purpose of the header file is to include all the most commonly used files), as your code can break if the includes change in the included files, and your code might not compile on some compilers. Since you\u2019re using std::string, you need to include <string>.\n \n- If you don\u2019t need the functionally that std::string provides, use std::string_view, from <string_view>, instead, as it is much faster since it doesn\u2019t dynamically allocate any memory. std::string_view is pretty much a replacement for C\u2019s const char *. Since you\u2019re only viewing the contents of the string, std::string_view is perfect for you. Because std::string_view was added in C++17, you\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019re compiling the project as C++17.\n \n- if you just want to end the line, use `\\n`.

Here\u2019s some examples:\n \n- Dynamic memory allocation. When you allocate memory using new, you get a pointer to the memory you just allocated. You shouldn\u2019t really be using new or owning memory using raw pointers, unless you have a good reason to. Instead, use a smart pointer, like std::unique_ptr, for the added safety net.\n \nE.g.\n \n    std::unique_ptr<int> num{std::make_unique<int>(25)};\n    std::cout << *num << \u2018\\n\u2019;\n \n- Polymorphic objects. You can create a base class and have multiple classes inherit from it. Then, you can create a pointer to the base class and give it a memory address of any of the sub classes.\n \nE.g.\n \n    // Same pointer types, pointing to different class types. \n    std::unique_ptr<Base> base1{std::make_unique<Sub1>()};\n    std::unique_ptr<Base> base2{std::make_unique<Sub2>()};\n \n- Pointers are reassignable, while references are not. This means that references must be given a value immediately upon creation, and you cannot have them reference a different variable. Because pointers are just integers storing a memory address, you can assign a different memory address to them at any time. You can even just assign nullptr to them, then give them a real value later.\n \nE.g.\n \n    int a{64};\n    int b{32};\n    \n    int &ref{a};\n    int *ptr{&a};\n    \n    ref = b; // Assigns a to b, ref still references a.\n    ptr = &b; // Ptr now points to b, the value of \u201ca\u201d remains unchanged.\n \n- You also might be using pointers a lot if you\u2019re working with a C library, as references don\u2019t exist in C, so you\u2019ll end up using pointers for things you would typically use a reference for.\n \nHere are some more less common uses of pointers that you might find in legacy code:\n \n- Optional function parameters. You can have a function take in a pointer, and have it check whether it\u2019s nullptr or not. If it is, ignore it, otherwise do something with it. Since C++17, you should be using std::optional to achieve this.\n \n- Writing data to a specific memory address. If a function needs to return multiple data, you can have it take in pointers, to which it will write the data to. You\u2019ll only really see this when working with C libraries, since in C++, you should use references for this, if possible.\n \n- Raw arrays. C-style arrays can be treated like they are pointers to the first element of the array. When a raw array is passed to a function, it also decays into a pointer. You should avoid raw arrays unless you have a good reason for using them, and instead use an STL container, like std::vector, std::array, std::unordered_map, or one of the many others.\n \n- Raw strings. C-style strings are just const arrays of characters, so you would typically just store a const pointer to them. You shouldn\u2019t really be using raw strings at all in C++. If you want the C++ equivalent of C-style strings, use std::string_view. If you want strings with more functionality, you can use std::string, at a small cost of slight performance loss compared to std::string_view.", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "01_Abhijeet", "text": "What should I learn next?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "renegade kitten", "text": "Got my Exams In a couple of weeks and my procrasinating ass just started opening the book.

I just finished the whole vid. where can U learn more?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "@Jude M haha I'll try to explain it better.\n \n- Although, for whatever reason, using namespace std is common in teaching material, you should avoid writing it, as it's widely considered to be bad practice. Just prefix everything from the standard library with std::.\n \ne.g.\n \n    std::string_view msg{\"Hello world!\"};\n    std::cout << msg << '\\n';\n \n-  If you want to end the line after outputting data to a stream, like std::cout, use '\\n' (see my previous example). If you want to end the line and also flush the stream, you can use std::endl. By default, std::cout is buffered, and its output is printed when the buffer is full, or when you insert a newline. If you want it to print right away, you can flush the stream.\n \ne.g.\n    \n    std::cout << \"Hello world\";\n    std::cout << std::flush;\n \nstd::endl will end the line, and flush the stream. If you don't need it to flush the stream, using std::endl is an unnecessary performance loss. Using '\\n' will also make your intention more clear.\n\n- Unless you have a reason to do otherwise, always initialize variables using uniform initialization, with { }.\n \ne.g.\n \n    const int num{25};\n    const int *const ptr{&num};\n    const std::string str{\"Hello World\"};\n    const std::string &ref{str};\n\nUniform initialization is safer and the rules for it are simpler. Unlike other forms of initialization, uniform initialization does not allow implicit narrowing. For instance, you can assign a float to a double, but not a double to a float, because double is twice the size of a float, and so a float cannot hold its value. If you for whatever reason needed to do this anyway, you can do so by explicitly casting.\n \ne.g.\n \n    double d{32.0};\n    float f1{d}; // Error, implicit narrowing conversion not allowed.\n    float f2{static_cast<float>(d)}; // Ok.\n    \n    float ff{32.0f};\n    double dd{ff}; // Ok.\n\nAnother reason to use uniform initialization is because it avoids the most vexing parse. For example, consider this line:\n \n    Foo foo(Foo());\n\nYou might think that that line is creating a variable of type Foo, by invoking its copy constructor, copying the passed-in temporary Foo object. In reality, it is actually a function declaration, returning a Foo object, and taking in an unnamed parameter of type Foo. This is how compilers are required to interpret it. However, in this example:\n \n    Foo foo{Foo{}};\n\nIt actually creates a variable. You should also know that uniform initialization will always prefer initializer lists, which means that if there's a constructor taking in an std::initializer_list,  uniform initialization will always call that constructor. Consider this:\n \n    std::vector<int> vec{8};\n\nIn case you don't know, std::vector has a constructor taking in a size_type count variable. This constructor will allocate enough memory for \"count\" amount of elements. It may look like that's what that line is doing, but it is actually calling the constructor taking in an std::initializer_list, so it actually creates a vector with one element in it, the int with value of 8. If this is not your intention, you can get around this by using the old-style of initialization, using ( ). \n \n- Maybe prefer the pre-increment operator, ++x, over the post-increment operator, x++. These two are not identical. The former simply increments the variable, then returns the result. The latter, on the other hand, will create a copy of the old value, increment the variable, then return that old value.\n\nE.g.\n \n    int a{1};\n    int b{1};\n    \n    std::cout << ++a << '\\n';\n    std::cout << b++ << '\\n';\n    \n    Output:\n    2\n    1\n\nFor fundamental types, it doesn't make much difference, if any at all, so it doesn't really matter which one you use. However, if you're incrementing a larger object, using the post-increment operator when the pre-increment operator will do just fine can lead to unnecessary performance loss. It's pretty common practice to always use the pre-increment operator (++x), unless you *need* to get the old value first, in which case you can use the post-increment operator (x++).\n \nHope this helps.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Jude M", "text": "@Artem Katerynych although I don't doubt anything you just said, I don't know what anything you said means.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "You shouldn\u2019t do using namespace std, it\u2019s bad practice.

Also, prefer uniform initialization, with { }, over other forms of initialization, like copy initialization, with =, or ( ) initialization. Lastly, you should maybe prefer the pre-increment operator (++x), over post increment (x++), as the latter will create a copy of the variable, as it increments the variable, but returns the original value, unlike the former, which increments the variable and returns the new value. The copy isn\u2019t a big deal when using fundamental types, but for bigger types, it could be an unnecessary loss of performance.

The conditions you put in your loops are very unnecessary, as they will never be false. If you want the loop to run forever, you can just do while (true).\n \nE.g.\n \n    int main()\n    {\n        int i{0};\n        while (true)\n            std::cout << i++ << \u2018\\n\u2019;\n    }", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "@Name Unavailable Then in case you don\u2019t know, that for loop does the same exact thing your while loop does, only in a much simpler and nicer way. The first statement in the for loop is the iterator variable. It just keeps track of what iteration the loop is on. The iterator variable is typically either an integer type, or an iterator object, like std::vector<T>::iterator (https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-iterators/). The second statement is the condition. The for loop will continue looping as long as this condition is true. The last statement will be executed at every loop iteration. It is typically used to increment or decrement the iterator variable.\n \nAlso, a few other things wrong with your code:\n  \n- Prefer uniform initialization, using { } over the other forms of initialization, like ( ), or copy initialization, which is done with =.\n \nE.g.\n   \n    int i{25};\n    int ii{0};\n    int iii{} // Initializes to zero.\n    \n    std::string_view s{\u201cHello, World!\u201d};\n \n- You maybe should prefer pre-increment (++x) over post-increment (x++). The difference between those two is that pre-increment first increments the variable, then returns the result, and post-increment creates a copy, increments the variable, then returns the copy. This way you get the old value first.\n \nE.g.\n    \n    int a{0};\n    int b{0};\n    std::cout << ++a << \u2018\\n\u2019;\n    std::cout << b++ << \u2018\\n\u2019;\n   \n    Output:\n    1\n    0\n     \nFor fundamental types, it doesn\u2019t really matter which one you chose as the difference is negligible. But for bigger types, the unnecessary copy could be expensive.\n \n- If you need to end the line and flush the stream, use std::endl. If you just want to end the line, use \u2018\\n\u2019.\n \n-Avoid doing using namespace std as it is widely considered to be bad practice. Just prefix everything from the standard library with std::.\n \nE.g.\n \n    std::cout << \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\\n\u201d;\n    std::string name;\n    std::getline(std::cin, name);\n \nHowever, if you\u2019re in a limited scope, such as a function, and you\u2019re using something from a namespace with a long name (like std::chrono), it\u2019s ok to write using namespace. An alternative that\u2019s probably even better would be to just expose only the symbols you need with a using declaration.\n \nE.g.\n \n    using std::chrono::steady_clock;\n    const steady_clock::time_point now{steady_clock::now()};\n \nHope this helps.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Name Unavailable", "text": "@Artem Katerynych int main()\r\n{\r\n    for (int i = 1; i<= 5; i--) {\r\n        cout << i<< endl;\r\n    }\r\n     return 0;\r\n}\n\ni just found another", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Name Unavailable", "text": "@Artem Katerynych i just started to learn..i am not a rookie or a pro ..i am noob", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "You can just do this:\n \n    int main()\n    {\n        for (int i{0}; i < 100; ++i)\n            std::cout << i << \u2018\\n\u2019;\n        return 0;\n    }\n    \nMuch simpler.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u674e\u666f\u5929", "text": "the c++ you learn: book mybook(); the c++ you see: std::shared_ptr <book> mybook{ book::create(), CleanUpBookResource };", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "@\u674e\u666f\u5929 well maybe a lot inexperienced people don\u2019t do it, but it\u2019s pretty common to see it in more advanced code.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "\u674e\u666f\u5929", "text": "@Artem Katerynych still, most programmers don't do {}, when is the last time you see people do int a{2}; not very often.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "@\u674e\u666f\u5929 Actually from what I\u2019ve seen, most good code uses uniform initialization.

A namespace just provides a named scope for your symbols. Here\u2019s an example:\n \n    namespace io\n    {\n       inline void print(std::string_view str) noexcept\n        {\n            std::cout <<str << \u201c\\n\u201d;\n        }\n    }\n  \n    namespace revIo\n    {\n        void print(std::string str) noexcept\n        {\n            std::reverse(str.begin(), str.end());\n            std::cout << str << \u201c\\n\u201d;\n        } \n    }\n     \n    int main()\n    {\n        io::print(\u201cHello\u201d); // Prints the string \u201cHello.\u201d\n        revIo::print(\u201cHello\u201d); // Prints the string \u201cHello\u201d in reverse.\n        print(\u201cHello\u201d); // Error, no such function exists.\n    } \n \nWhat using namespace std does is tell the compiler to treat all symbols defined in the namespace std as if they were defined in the global namespace. This way, you don\u2019t have to prefix everything that\u2019s a part of the standard library with std::. Doing using namespace std is widely considered to be bad practice, so you should probably avoid doing it. However, doing using namespace x is alright when you\u2019re in a smaller scope, such as a function. It could be useful if that function is using just that one library, or if it\u2019s using something from a namespace with a long name, such as std::chrono. If you\u2019re still going to be writing using namespace at a file-wide scope, just remember to *never do using namespace in a header file.* Since the include directive just copies and pastes the contents of the included file, every time you include that file you\u2019ll bring the using namespace statement with you, and this could introduce a heaps of issues.\n \nAlso, if you don\u2019t already know, you can also just expose a single symbol into the global namespace like this:\n \n    using std::cout; // Only exposes std::cout.\n    std::string in;\n    cout << \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\\n\u201c;\n    std::cin >> in;\n    cout << \u201cHello, \u201c << in << \u201c\\n\u201d;", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Misha Hinton", "text": "After creating the new project, I clicked, \"Build and Run,\" but got a \"No Such File or Directory,\"  instead of, \"Hello World\".\nI didn't change a thing.

Plane refers to the Standing Bodies of Water, which are always level), which is created because of Intent, Intelligent Design. If you want to watch a quick video to sum all this up, it's explained phenomenally by a Scientist (Realist) known as Del: https://youtu.be/TXWAMyLb-xs and also: https://youtu.be/pKYywPYJfWo\n\nHere's why:\n\nFirst of all, remember that Science DOES NOT belong to any institution. It DOES NOT belong to a particular group or person. It belongs to every single human being alive.\nThe ones searching for truths according to the type of the claim become Scientists. People searching for truths also become Realists (Truth Seekers). Science means exploring the inner and outer surroundings of ourselves.\n\nThere are three different types of Sciences:\nA) Natural Science\nB) Formal Science\nC) Social Science\n\nSocial Science deals with people and their behaviours. Formal Science deals with Mathematics and it's assumptions (Mathematics is a language, which means that we can create anything and make it mathematically correct, but that means NOTHING in real life), Natural Science deals with Objective Reality (The immediate or physical reality). If someone claims that something exists in the Objective World, OTRMDPPs are needed for that claim to be Scientifically Proven. OTRMDPPs means Observable, Testable, Repeatable, Measurable, Demonstrable, Practical Proofs which MUST be verifiable by every single human being alive. Without OTRMDPPs, the claimed thing is considered pseudoscience, or a belief.\n\nI now shall ask the question \"What is the shape of the earth we stand upon?\" and then immediately proceed to look for OTRMDPPs. I found out that some lands are elevated (Mountains), some lands are deviated, some lands are level. We can then conclude that the lands are Irregular in shape, which means not all lands are elevated, not all lands are deviated.\n\nThe next OTRMDPP is Water. Water is abundant. It is the second most important thing for human beings to survive (number one being air), which means that every single human being alive has access to it. The bodies of water are largely found in Oceans. I then found out that the bodies of water need a container to stay still (stand). If there isn't a container, I found out that they will flow until they find the lowest point to stand upon. Bodies of water stand, if there is a container, which means we can call them Standing Bodies of Water. I then found out that Standing Bodies of Water are always Level (Which means no elevation or deviation from the starting point to the end). If not messed with in any way (for example the air pushing the water), Standing Bodies of Water are also perfectly still.\n\nI then tried to pour some water in a completely sealed rectangle shaped container, this did the trick. The water then starting to fill up the container until the very top. If I pour any more water, it will flow away.\n\nI then measured it to see if it was perfectly level, and to my surprise, it was perfectly level without any deviation or elevation. Obviously water is the MOST perfect tool we got to make something level. Water takes the shape of a container.\n\nI then got an idea to use a sphere. I started to pour the water onto the sphere, but then the water flowed off from the sphere immediately to the lowest point, that tells me that Water DOES NOT conform to exterior of shapes.\n\nThere is also ANOTHER OTRMDPP. The floor cannot rise to our eye level if it were a ball, no matter the size. Because spherical geometry makes it impossible for floor on a ball to rise to our eye level. Watch this video for more info: https://youtu.be/o3jX96TVy5s\n\nWith the help of OTRMDPPs, I have concluded that the Earth is an Irregular Plane (Irregular refers to the Lands, which have elevation and deviation. Plane refers to the Standing Bodies of Water, which are always level).\n\nI will then ask another question \"Did something create this world?\". After searching for OTRMDPPs, I found that anything, be it dirt, or water, or rock, can't be created from thin air, stuff cannot pop out of thin air, not even randomly. With the help of OTRMDPPs, it is Scientifically Proven that this world has been created by Intelligent Design. There is absolutely no other option. This world, the entirety of it, is infinite. Because if there's a starting point and an end point, what created the starting point and end point? Then what created the one which created the starting point and end point? Where is it located? It's infinite regress. Only logical solution is infinite. Sure, our lives, the physical world may have a certian finite feature, but the whole thing, the primer mover, has got to be infinite, eternal. Watch this video for a better understanding: https://youtu.be/P3-1GrBTTdo\n\nNow I had some curious questions, \"What about the sky? What about the two light things that move in the sky? What about stars that move in the sky at night?\"\n\nBefore we go any further, I want you to remember about two more different things when it comes to the Objective World, the Intangible and the Tangible.\n\nIntangibles are those objects which are not in our immediate reality. For example, If I see a house far away, I cannot measure how far away it is or how big it is, I need to get near it first.\n\nTangibles are those objects which are available in our immediate reality. For example, I am typing this article on my iPad, which means that I can touch it, I can observe it in full 3D. I can rotate it around completely to touch and see the whole shape, I can measure it, I can also interact with it.\n\nThe sky is Intangible. The Moon is Intangible. The Sun is Intangible. The Stars are Intangible. OTRMDPPs are NOT available. Every single capable human being should be able to reach the sky and OTRMD with Practical Proofs the things in the sky in full 3D, if not, we do not know what those objects are in the sky, and trying to come up with ideas about what those might be are nothing but assumptions, ideas, beliefs. We live ON Earth, not IN the sky.\n\nNow, OTRMDPPs tell us that because this world contains Air Pressure, there is no other way, this world is CONTAINED. OTRMDPPs tell us that this world is CONTAINED in SOME way, we do not know the shape of the container. But without a solid container, Air Pressure is literally impossible, I'm afraid.\n\nTV Screens, hearsay, white coat guys talking nonsensical mathematical equations are NOTHING but beliefs and mental thoughts, TV Screens are NEVER going to be concluded as Scientific Proofs, the things shown in the TV Screens are NOT PHYSICAL.\n\nLast but not the least, one last question \"Why are things falling downwards?\" Well, the way things fall has NOTHING to do with the shape of the earth. \"But Gravity!\" What is \"Gravity\"? Can we OTRMD with Practical Proofs? NO. Is it a magical pulling force which allows some things to fly and pulls down some things to make them fall? Can two objects come closer without some sort of push? \"Yes, in space\" ARE YOU THIS STUPID? We live right NOW, on EARTH, not in some magical fantasy land! In order for two objects to come closer, I either have to push one object to the other from the front, or push the second object from it's back to the front. Motion is ONLY created if something presses on something else. Pull is just a term for push. Things that weigh more than air fall down, things that weigh less than air float.\n\nIf you want to go deeper and ask why do things even have weight, we have to first explore the whole earth to get a good understanding. But if you're curious anyway, I suggest you watch this video: https://youtu.be/G05dl2BenKE and this: https://youtu.be/XJ11coI7mas\n\n\"Why does it matter? I don't care about the shape!\" Well, I will address you some important questions, \"If the Earth is an Irregular Plane, why are these governments lying?\" They're lying because they don't want people to explore the world and find out what's out there. \"Don't you want to know about your existence, the purpose of life?\", they gave us a 2D map, they're showing the map everywhere, and people are accepting the map WITHOUT exploring the world! How can we verify or falsify a map without physically exploring first? We are trusting governments as if those corrupted psychopaths are our mom and dads! Do you like being imposed by strangers? All the governments are CONNECTED.\n\nIf we have the truths about our existence, about what created this, about the whole place, we do NOT need religions, philosophies, beliefs. The majority of people are in debts, some are poor, and some are incredibly and suspiciously rich... then HOW IS THIS A GOOD SYSTEM? The government is imposing it's subjective version of what's good and what's bad on the whole world and people are accepting it? You don't want equality, compassion, love, respect? If a person kidnapped ten people and he's forcing them to do things with or without their consent, he automatically becomes a criminal. What's the government doing? BOTH ARE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING, IMPOSING! THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION HAS STOCKHOLM SYNDROME!\n\nBut, of course, if you have OTRMDPPs that contradict reality, please feel free to share it with me. Thank you for reading this article. If you still have any doubts, please feel free to email me at \u202aMysteriousPlane@pm.me\u202c. Please remember that personalities have nothing to do with Objective Reality.\n\nI'm not associated with anyone, I can only represent myself.\n\nWe should not judge people by their personalities unless that's your game. I don't judge people by their personalities (His voice is a bit weird, his hands are tiny! His face is ugly! He is fat! He has tattoos!), I came for the content, and that's what I should think about.

You made all the BS in my textbook understandable. One thing that wasn't clear though is... WHY use pointers? They seem like a middleman. Why not just use the variables that they reference?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "roshiron 18", "text": "@Artem Katerynych Thank you for the informative response Artem!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "You use a pointer when you need to store a memory address.\n \nOne reason you may need to do that is when you dynamically allocate memory. When you allocate memory using new, you need to store the memory address it returns in a pointer. However, for dynamic memory allocation you should avoid using new and instead use a smart pointer like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr.\n \nAnother use for pointers is optional function parameters. If you want a parameter to be optional, you can just take it in as a pointer, then check if it\u2019s nullptr or not. If it is, you can just ignore it. For optional variables, you should actually use std::optional. However, it does not allow you to store references, so if you do not want to copy the data, you need to pass it as a pointer.\n \nPointers are also used for creating polymorphic variables. You can make a base class and have some sub-classes inherit from it. Then, you can create a pointer to a base class and set it to a memory address of any of the sub-classes. You can actually do this with references, but often you\u2019d need to dynamically allocate the memory for the objects, and in that case you\u2019d need to use a pointer.\n\nOne thing you can do with a pointer that you cannot do with a reference is reassign them. Although they behave sort of similar, don\u2019t think of references as pointers with nicer syntax. When you create a reference, it pretty much _becomes_ the variable itself, and you cannot reassign it. A pointer is just a memory address, and therefore you can give it a different memory address at any point.\n \nYou\u2019ll also be using pointers a lot if you\u2019re working with a C library. Since C is backwards compatible with C++, you\u2019ll probably end up using a C library at some point. Since C does not have references, pointers will be used for a lot of things. Other than things C has that I already mentioned, like dynamic memory allocation and optional parameters, pointers in C can be used to avoid copying data. Just like you\u2019d pass a variable by reference to avoid copying it in C++, you\u2019d need to pass the variable by a pointer. Pointers in C can also be used to write data to a specific memory address. At some point, you might need to call a function that is supposed to give you some data, but instead of returning said data, it instead expects a pointer. The function simply just dereferences the pointer and writes the data there. Since you can only return one variable, this is sometimes done when the function needs to give you multiple variables.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "STUDY HELPLINE", "text": "Bsc 2nd c++ no class \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Prakhar Ranjan", "text": "3:00:00 **ignore**", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Emanuel Raziel", "text": "Thanks a lot!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Woo Six", "text": "Hey, I heard this story about goegre somewhere before...", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "vanyAkun", "text": "I have a test tomorrow and here I am xDDDDD", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Neelabhro Ghosh", "text": "i just realised c++ is way faster than anything, its on a different league if u use visual studio u can see it in diagnostic window\n\nedit ://variables\n    bool incorrect = true;\n    \n    int tries = 0;\n    int count = 0;\n    \n\n\n    do \n    {\n        int max_value = 101;\n        int min_value = 1;\n        tries++;\n        int secretnum = rand() % max_value + min_value;\n        int randnum = rand() % max_value + min_value;\n        cout << \"\\nnum1 = \"<<secretnum << \"\\n num2 = \"<<  randnum;\n\n        if (secretnum == randnum )\n        {\n            if (tries == 1) \n            {\n                incorrect = false;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                count++;\n                    tries = 0;\n            \n            \n            }\n\n\n        }\n        \n    \n    } while (incorrect);\n    cout << \"\\n the no of counts: \" << count ;\n\n\n\njust mess with the max and min value and run  it see its speed just dont put he value too high or it'll run forever cu the probability will get very low", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "SUCHI", "text": "Is everything taught in here?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Warren Hawker", "text": "haha no, this is just the basics.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Captain Cosback", "text": "49:00 this is just to remind me of where I am please ignore", "likes": 21}, "replies": [{"author": "Ozyoo", "text": "sorry i can't ignore", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Flamur Sejdiu", "text": "Ok", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Trezzy", "text": "ok", "likes": 0}, {"author": "phohecks", "text": "OK", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Vagabond", "text": "Ok", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mattia Trapella", "text": "3:36:03 I see a the office reference...

If you do not need the function to return some data, you can just make the return type void. The main function needs to return an exit code. If it returns 0, it means that the program ran fine. If the program ran into an issue, you\u2019d usually return a non-0 value. You can actually omit the return statement from the main function, and the compiler will implicitly add one for you, which will just return 0.\n\nTo answer your second question, a function that does have a return statement in it returns some data. For example:\n \n    int add(int a, int b) noexcept\n    {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n \nThat function calculates a + b and returns the result. If a function has a non-void return type and doesn\u2019t return anything, it will result in undefined behaviour (if you\u2019re in debug mode, usually the compiler won\u2019t even try to compile it). If the function does have a void return type, there is no need to add a return statement, although you can if you want to return out of the function early. Return statements in void functions just exit out of the function without giving you any data.\n \nE.g.\n \n    void foo() noexcept\n    {\n        // If condition is true, only this part will be executed.\n        if (condition)\n        {\n            statement1();\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // This part will only be executed if the condition is not true.\n        statement2();\n        statement3();\n        }", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Wan Khai", "text": "@Artem Katerynych plus what is the different between function that has 'return' and the function that doesnt have 'return' in it", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Wan Khai", "text": "@Artem Katerynych that guy said when we declare a function, we need tu put 'return' in the end right like return 0...then after we run the code we will get 0 back,and the value can be any number right? i can put 'return 3'...so after i run the code i will get 3 back...so what i want to ask is can this value 0 or 3 that i put be any useful for me?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "What do you mean by console returning a value? std::cin?", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "music to meditate", "text": "Understanding\ud83d\ude0a", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Daniela Ofan", "text": "This guy was born to teach!", "likes": 32}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sezgin KARAPINAR", "text": "Wonderful job.Very helpful.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Aashay Patil", "text": "Dude I have downloaded this now and the new update is out 20.3 and it's not exactly as the video and it's asking for plugin before new project .

What can be considered good Java code, could be very bad C++ code. Java is much simpler, and is used for different tasks than C++. C++ is a much more complicated language as it offers better performance and more control.\n \nAs a very very simple example, this is how you create a new object in Java:\n \nFoo foo = new Foo();\n \nYou can do the same thing in C++ like this:\n \nFoo *foo = new Foo{};\n \nBut unless you for some reason need to allocate the object on the free-store, this is a bad idea, as allocating it on the stack would probably be faster.\n\nFoo foo;\n\nIn Java, that would actually create a null pointer, but in C++, it creates a new object on the stack. If you did need to allocate it on the free-store, doing so with new is probably a bad idea, as you would have to manually manage the memory, and it can sometimes not be exception safe. Instead, you\u2019d need to do it the RAII way.\n \n// Unique pointer is used here, but you can also use a different smart pointer, like shared_ptr if you need shared ownership.\nstd::unique_ptr<Foo> foo{std::make_unique<Foo>()};\n\nYou may also have noticed that instead of using (), I used { }. That is because those two initialize variables a bit differently. You can use () just like you can in Java:\n \nFoo *foo = new Foo();\n\nBut in C++, you should always prefer to initialize variables with { }. The rules for it are simpler, less ambiguous, and safer than other forms of initialization.\n\nAs you can see, even something simple like creating a new object is very different between these two languages. \n \nIf you want another example, here\u2019s how you cast in Java:\n \n    float f = 32.0f;\n    System.out.println((int)f);\n \nBut in C++, although you can still use the C-style cast, it is recommended that you actually specify what type of cast you want. For this example, you\u2019d use static_cast:\n    \n    float f = 32.0f;\n     std::cout << static_cast<int>(f);\n  \nIn C++, there\u2019s static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, c-style cast, and function-style casts. \n  \nI hope this helps you understand how these two languages are completely different, apart from they\u2019re similar syntax.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "opkp", "text": "@Artem Katerynych Thanks for explaining it to me, Thanks!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "opkp", "text": "@Artem Katerynych can you please elaborate.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "Java has similar syntax because it was influenced by C++, but other than similar syntax, they\u2019re completely different languages.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "ashiiita", "text": "Stop seeing comments start learning c++", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "SUSMITA CHAKRABORTY", "text": "You are a great teacher bro.

For example, int a[5] will allocate 5 * sizeof(int) bytes of memory. If you want to be able to resize your array, you would need to dynamically allocated the memory of your array using new, then when you resize it, just move or copy everything from your old memory block to a new larger block.\n \nBut typically, you want to avoid using raw arrays. Use an STL container instead. If you want a stack allocated array of fixed size, use std::array. If you want a container that can easily be resized, std::vector could be a good option.

When you allocate memory on the free-store/heap, you will need to store that memory address in a pointer so that you could access that memory. For this, you should use a smart pointer, like std::unique_ptr.\n  \nYou can also use pointers for polymorphism. You can create a base class and have different subclasses inherit from it. Then you can create some instances of those subclasses and store all of them as a base class pointer. You can also use references for this, but not when you need them to be allocated on the free-store/heap.\n  \nPointers can be used for optional function parameters. You can just pass a variable to a function as a pointer, then check if it points to a valid memory address. If it\u2019s nullptr, the function can just ignore it. You should probably use std::optional for this though.\n  \nPointers are sometimes used to write data to a specific memory address. You can pass a pointer to a function and then it can write some data at that memory address. This is sometimes done when you need your function to return something, but also provide some additional information. However, you should probably use references for this.\n \nPointers are also used with raw arrays. Raw arrays are just pointers to sequential data. If you can, you should avoid using raw arrays and just use an STL container instead, like std::array or std::vector.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "All-Round Tech", "text": "I don't understand why don't this code pring \"You win\" on winning the guessing game ->\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int num = 4;\r\n    int guess;\r\n    int chanses = 3;\r\n\r\n    while(num != guess){\r\n        if(chanses != 0) {\r\n            cout << \"Please type your guess: \";\r\n            cin >> guess;\r\n            chanses -= 1;\r\n        }else if (guess == num){\r\n            cout << \"YOu win\";\r\n        }else {\r\n            cout << \"you lost the game\";\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "MarsBorn", "text": "This tutorial saved my ass this semester.

You can create a base class and have different classes inherit from it. Then, you can create a pointer to the base class but point it to an instance of a sub-class. This can also be achieved with references.\n \nAnother popular use of pointers is free-store/heap allocation. If you need to allocate some memory dynamically rather than on the stack, you need to use a pointer to access that memory.\n \nPointers can also be used to avoid copying data. Instead of passing a variable by value, you can instead just pass the memory address of that variable. The function can then dereference it and access the data. However, it would be much easier to just use references for this.\n \nYou can also use pointers for optional function parameters. If you pass a pointer to a function, the function can check if it is pointing a valid memory address or not. If the pointer is nullptr, it can just ignore it. However, the same can be done better with std::optional.\n \nPointers are also used with raw arrays, since raw arrays are just pointers to sequential data. Most of the time, you should just avoid raw arrays and use an STL container instead, like std::vector or std::array.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Hanadi AlAmrany", "text": "Why when I click the build and run button it didn't work ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "P 2", "text": "I've learned more at 1:00 than I learned in an entire semester in a C++ community college class.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ahmad Kamal Hamdy Ibrahim Khattab", "text": "Guys im 17 years old and i like programming from where should i learn advanced levels of c++", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Judah Weesner", "text": "For some reason visual studio gives me an error saying: \"identifier is undefined\" when i type getline.

Once you feel confident with C++, you can start learning how to make games. \n \nIf you want to use a game engine, you can find an engine you like and learn how to use it. Unreal Engine is a very popular choice for C++. \n \nIf you want to make games from scratch, you should start by learning how to use a graphics library. You should begin with a simple one that handles everything for you, like SDL2 or SFML. \n \nSDL2, short for Simple Direct Media-layer, is a cross-platform library that handles graphics, audio, input, and much more. It is written in C, but can easily be used in C++. SDL is very popular, and even some AAA games use SDL. The core SDL library handles the basic things, like graphics, input, basic audio support, etc. To extend its functionality, you can get other SDL sub-libraries that handle more specific things. There is SDL_image for loading images from a variety of different file types, SDL_mixer for enchanted audio support, SDL_ttf for font support, and SDL_net for networking support. This allows you to get only what you need, and if you don\u2019t like how SDL handles one thing, you can just substitute it with a different library.\n\nSFML stands for simple and fast multimedia library. It is similar to SDL, but it is written in C++. It is not as popular as SDL, but it is often used by beginners. Unlike SDL, everything in SFML comes in just one single library.\n\nI\u2019ve used both SFML and SDL, and personally I like SDL the best.\n\nOnce you gain some experience with game development, you can pick up a graphics API  that lets you do everything yourself. OpenGL is a very popular choice as it is cross-platform, and is probably one of the easiest to learn. Both SDL and SFML can be used with OpenGL. You can also learn how to use a platform specific graphics API, like DirectX which is only available on Windows.", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Lil Trop", "text": "how can anyone dislike this", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nachiketh", "text": "everything went over my head at the last hour damn", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Account Support", "text": "58:21 floor gang", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Michael Padilla", "text": "Very well done.

The reason you have to do this, is because everything in the standard library is defined in the std namespace. Namespaces provide a scope to all the identifiers. They are used to prevent name collisions, and keep code more organized. If you don\u2019t want to prefix all the standard library code with std, you can use the using keyword. You can make the compiler treat all identifiers within the specified namespace by doing using namespace your_namespace;\n \nE.g.\n \nusing namespace std;\nstring str{\u201cHello World\u201d};\ncout << str << \u201c\\n\u201d;\n \nHowever, this is often considered bad practice. You should only use using namespace when you are in a limited scope, such as a function, and are using something from a namespace with a long name.\n\nYou can also do something like this:\n \nusing std::string;\nstring a{\u201cHello\u201d};\nstring b{\u201cWord\u201d};\nstd::cout << a << \u201c \u201c << b << \u201c\\n\u201d;\n \nThis is better than doing using namespace, but in this case it\u2019s still unnecessary since the standard namespace name is very short, so it\u2019s not that difficult to type the full name out.\n \nAlso, you shouldn\u2019t use the assignment operator to initialize objects. You should initialize everything with {}.\n\nE.g.\n\nstd::chrono::milliseconds ms{1500};\n \nHowever, I still like to use the assignment operator to initialize only fundamental types, references, and pointers.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Weevez", "text": "Too short :(", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "The Turkey", "text": "Could someone please tell me where I can get some basic exercises to do to ensure that I have grasped the basics taught in this video", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "The Turkey", "text": "@Rohan S Thanks\ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Rohan S", "text": "Hackerrank, codeforces, codechef, project euler, spoj, atcoder, topcoder - loads of places.

For serious projects, I prefer to download the source code, and compile the library myself. To do this, right click on your solution in the solution explorer, go to Add, and click New Project. From there, create an empty C++ project. Then, I like to click on the Show All Files button in solution explorer. This will let you see how the project actually looks on the drive, without all the fake folders. I usually make a folder called Source, and copy all the source files there. Then, right click on the project, and click properties. Make sure that the configuration is set to all configurations, and platform is set to all platforms. In the general tab, click Configuration Type, and change it from application to either static library or dynamic library. Next, right click on your main project, and go to Build Dependencies. Then, click Project Dependencies, and select your library project. Now you can compile your projects. If you chose to compile it as a dynamic library, go to the library project\u2019s output and get the .dll file, then move it the your main project\u2019s output dir.\n \nTo setup a library without the source code, you should create a folder in your project dir that will contain all your libraries. I usually call it Dependencies.\nMake sure that you have created at least 1 .cpp file in your project. Then, right click on your project in the solution explorer and click properties. Make sure that your configuration is set to all configurations, and your platform is set to all platforms.\n \nIn the general tab, I usually change the output and intermediate dir, as the default ones aren\u2019t very good. I wouldn\u2019t give it local paths though, instead I\u2019d start the path with $(ProjectDir), followed by the path name. You should also set the C++ standard to the latest one, which is currently C++17.\n \nThen, click on the little arrow next to C/C++, and click general. From there, you can specify the include directories. Libraries usually have an include folder, and a lib folder. You want to link the include folder here. You probably shouldn\u2019t give it a local path though, instead write $(SolutionDir)Dependencies\\YOUR_LIB_NAME\\include\\\n \nThen, click the arrow on next to Linker, and click general. Even if you\u2019re dynamically linking a library, libraries typically still come with static .lib files. This is because the static library files import all the definitions from the dll files for you, so that you wouldn\u2019t have to do that manually. All the actual code will be defined in the .dll files. You can provide the lib folder path by clicking Additional Library Directories. You can use the $(SolutionDir) macro here as well. Your library may have an x86 and an x64 version, so you may have to switch to the specific platform first by clicking on Platform, then selecting the one you need. Then, click Input, then click Additional Dependencies. Here you specify the .lib files that you want to use. Just write each file name that you want to use, with .lib at the end of each name.\n\nNext, if you dynamically linked your libraries, compile your program, then go to the output dir. Once you\u2019re there, move all the .dll files you need here.\n \nTo change your SDK, right click on your project in Solution Explorer, and click properties. In the general tab, click Windows SDK version. This will let you select from an SDK version from your installed SDKs. By default, it\u2019s set to the highest version you have installed.

Can someone help me with my C++ homework? It's below:\n\nWrite a program that uses random number generations to create sentences.\nThe program should use four arrays of pointers to char called article,noun verb and preposition. The program should create a sentence by selecting a word at random from which array in the following order: article, noun, verb, preposition, article and noun. As each word is picked it should be concatenated to the previous word in a character array that is big enough to hold the entire sentence. The words should be separated by spaces. When the final sentence is output , it should start with a capital letter and end with a period. The program should generate 20 such sentences. The arrays should be filled as follows: The article array should contain the articles \"the\" , \"a\" , \" one\" , \"some\" and \"any\" ; the noun array should contain the nouns \"boy\", \"girl\" , \" dog\" ,  \"town\" and \"car\"; the verb array should contain the verbs \"drove\" , \"jumped\" , \"ran\", \"walked \" and \"skipped \"; the preposition array should contain the prepositions \"to\", \"from\" , \"over\", \"under\" and \"on\".

You can think of it this way, even though the internal implementation is similar to a pointer. For example, this is a reference variable:\n\n\nint& my_reference = variable;\n\n\nnow you can use both my_reference and variable interchangeably.

The total basics were not covered for example, some more data structures, date and time, basic input/output, namespaces, dynamic memory, etc. Furthermore if you actually say to someone that you are going to teach objects... well... it's only 20% accomplished.

Everyone should learn C++ but *ALMOST* no one should be using C++ imo.\nBefore everyone jumps down my throat, let me justify that opinion XD\n \nThere are 2 main reasons why one would choose to use C/C++ to develop a piece of software and those 2 reasons are also 2 reasons why people should avoid it in most instances.\n\n1.) C/C++ has unmatched memory management given to the user that almost or no language higher gives the coder. This also means you're required to manage resources on your own for even the smallest of programs.\n\n2.) C/C++ compiles to native binaries which runs extremely fast. However, this comes at the expense of rapid development. Ask yourself this; are you willing to sacrifice rapid development for an application speed increase that the vast majority of the time, won't even be noticeable to the end user ?( in most cases minded, data crunching large data sets will obviously yield much more favorable results for C/C++ )\n\nA note about pointers. Don't know if it was due to trying to explain pointers as simply as possible but the explanation wasn't quite on point so here goes;\n\n&var_name gives you a memory address to where your value is being stored.\n*ptr_name gives you a memory address to where an address to where &var_name is being stored which changes if the address for var_name ever changes.\n\n&var_name = your street address to where your house is located.\n*ptr_name = a P.O Box with your street address inside to where your house is located.\n\nwith *ptr_name, your house can change; expand, or shrink, your address can change but you still keep the same P.O Box that's automatically updated with the new address.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "bali briton", "text": "I dont have IDE and terminal... wat do I do to download them", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "bali briton", "text": "windows it has command prompt", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Alex Vogt", "text": "you can tell this he has watched the show lost!!! with his \"lucky\" number in the array section!!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "weightgobrr", "text": "could all this be done in visual studio in the same way?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Mateusz Peryt", "text": "Of course , its better in vs", "likes": 0}, {"author": "The 2K KING", "text": "Yes", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Wahaj Ashraf", "text": "Can I use Sublime Text ???", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nitesh Khambe", "text": "I hit the like button right after I seen ur face..........

All the repetition throughout the course is great for watching and learning.\n\n\nLearning is not a race. Most guides / tutorials will only say things once, and then expect you to be a complete master of it and maybe similar commands the next time they use them. When these crash courses get to part 2, they will be way way beyond beginner level. Although all the information needed is there and explained. Beginners won't be able to use the \"learned\" information properly that way, because they haven't formed an idea of what they saw and what it meant. They got the answer, no problem. However. Only a copy of the answer, nothing more.\n\n\nIf a tutorial doesn't go into great length about boring details you \"already know about\", then you know it isn't a good one. If you don't need that, then just skip the detailed parts or find a tutorial meant for those who already mastered what you're trying to learn. I bet you'll end up back where you started though, since you will need to read up again on the boring basics to understand what they are actually talking about.

As a programmer I found the UE interface to be a bit child like and gimmicky compared to the more monotone basic look of unity however both engines are more than capable of doing what you need for pretty much any game style you just have to learn to make it do what you need ! :) Happy learning and I hope whatever you do pick you have success with !", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Jtag Solutions", "text": "@Mike Brooks C# is very object oriented where as C++ supports object oriented programming but isnt like C# in that aspect :)", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Chubbzchannel", "text": "I'm working in ue4 and learning c++ at the same time.

Instead, always prefix standard library functions or types with std::\n(Trust me, it's not that hard to get used to and you'll avoid a ton of bugs)\n\nFor, say, print-heavy functions, you could prefix the code *inside* a function with \"using std::cout; using std::endl;\" to then not have to write std::cout and std::endl all the time (instead only writing cout and endl)\n\nAnd finally, don't overuse std::endl. Most of the time all you want is to add a \\n.
