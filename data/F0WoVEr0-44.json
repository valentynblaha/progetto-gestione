Then you Google what programming language you need for your purpose (c++, c#, lua, java, js for gamedev. python for data, machine learning and web programming. Php only for web, js for web). To learn any programming language I advise YouTube channel \" the new boston\". When you've learned syntaxes and bases, start practicing and working on some real project. And if you're good in English, you may get cs50 course before you start learning the language. Maybe you will not understand all concepts at first time, it's ok, don't give up.
