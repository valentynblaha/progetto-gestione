I will recommend you to watch Django or Flask series by Corey Schafer. His videos are amazing for a beginner. \n\nFlask is light, easier than Django, whereas Django is robust, and slightly harder than Flask. If you want to wash a plate, then the tap is Flask. You have to arrange soap and cloth using your technique to wash the dish/plate. Whereas the whole kitchen will be Django. You can also customise your kitchen as you want, but a little bit harder because Django is monolithic.
