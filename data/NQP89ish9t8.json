So they work by interacting with operating systems. Node is a js runtime environment that lets you write in javascript but it uses another language (i believe c#, but I may be wrong, to interact with the OS itself). Not sure if that's basic to you or not, but it confused me for quite sometime when I just started. If it did help you though, and you're interested in server side languages as opposed to javascript on server then perhaps a class on C or Java may help you.
