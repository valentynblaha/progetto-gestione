For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. John 3:16-17\n\nJesus is The Son of God who was sent to the earth from Heaven to die on the Cross to save humans from burning in hell FOREVER. He took the punishment who us who deserve to be punished. So since He died and Rose again, we can now be free from hell and He offers us everlasting life meaning to live FOREVER with Him in Heaven or the New Earth. All we have to do to receive this free Gift is to believe in Jesus, believe in that He died for yours sins and believe that He Resurrected (came back to Life) on the third day. Once you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is LORD you will be saved. (Saved from hell). He is coming soon, tomorrow is not a promise so please dont waste time, put your faith in Jesus while there is still time, so you wont have any regrets. Jesus the Only Way, the Truth, and the Life. Once you have Jesus you have everything you need. You have freedom with Jesus. Besides you can see literally see nearly everything the Bible talks about comes through so why doubt when you can see the Truth unfolding in front of our eyes. If you want to know anything at all regarding Jesus you can ask. God Loves you, Jesus Loves you.\n\nhttps://t.co/Z3z5QmW3PE\nHe has never failed me and never will. Jesus said if we ask for anything in His Name we will get it.\nIf you wish to join a Whatsapp Group Bible Group, anyone is free to join.

Properties interact in weird and unknowable ways, overriding each other and contradicting each other. No part of web development is as frustrating as css. What bothers me is that it is that it doesn't need to be a written language (I know it is not a language ) but why are we writing it out like it is javascript. Surely it would be better to have a photoshop like gui where you drag and drop items, reshape, resize and position them using them using a visual mock up on them. I hate CSS with a passion.
