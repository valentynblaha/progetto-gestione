He is coming soon, tomorrow is not a promise so please dont waste time, put your faith in Jesus while there is still time, so you wont have any regrets. Jesus the Only Way, the Truth, and the Life. Once you have Jesus you have everything you need. You have freedom with Jesus. Besides you can see literally see nearly everything the Bible talks about comes through so why doubt when you can see the Truth unfolding in front of our eyes.

What bothers me is that it is that it doesn't need to be a written language (I know it is not a language ) but why are we writing it out like it is javascript. Surely it would be better to have a photoshop like gui where you drag and drop items, reshape, resize and position them using them using a visual mock up on them. I hate CSS with a passion.
