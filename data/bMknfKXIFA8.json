Hence we rely on compilers like Babel/Typescript that transform JSX into traditional Javascript that browsers understand. \n\nWhen we create a project locally with toolkits like create-react-app it includes a JSX transformer for us. This transforms the JSX we write into React.createElement(...) calls. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children). \n\nEg: <p>Content</p> becomes React.createElement('p', null, 'Content') and hence we need to import React for our transformed code to use createElement method. Though we don\u2019t call this method directly, this is what happens under the hood. So technically, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript.\n\nNow since React 17 things are a little different. Instead of transforming JSX to React.createElement calls, the new JSX transform automatically also imports what it needs. For the same example, this is what happens internally.\n\nimport {jsx as _jsx} from 'react/jsx-runtime';\n_jsx('h1', { children: 'Hello world' });\n\nSince the compiler already imports what it needs you can write JSX without having to explicitly import React. This makes more sense right? If you\u2019re just writing JSX and don\u2019t use any React.createElement() calls in your code then why bother importing it?", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Milan Berlik", "text": "I really enjoy this tutorial so far.

Not sure I understand which part of that upsets you so much, but maybe the added context will bring some clarity.\n\nHaving taught web dev to beginners for > 7 years now, I've learned that React can be a bit overwhelming for students when they have to learn the syntax and how to \"think in React\" alongside also struggling with local environment setup and differences from one computer to the next. Not sure how many times I've given up on a tutorial because the teacher's environment worked when mine wasn't. What Scrimba sacrifices in teaching local setup, it gains back by reducing disparate environment issues, reducing imposter syndrome when someone gets lost in the setup process, and lowering the bar to having students actually write code alongside the instructor instead of just watching without practicing.\n\nAnyway, feel free to move along to another React tutorial.

Based on the warning you're getting, it sounds like you never use the setContact function you get from calling React.useState.  I don't remember what part of the video you're in so I can't really walk you through it.  But basically you need to figure out what is supposed to trigger changing the contact.  Wherever that is supposed to happen, you need to call setContact(x), where x is the value contact is supposed to be.  For example a 1 line version, if you wanted this to happen when a button is pressed, the jsx would look something like <button onClick={() => {setContact(x)}}>Click me</button>.  It is important that you have the onClick={() => {setContact(x)}} instead of just onClick={setContact(x)}.  The difference is that in the correct version, you are creating a function which CALLS setContact with a value of x to the onClick.  If you do it the other way, you are actually calling the function setContact, instead of passing in a function that calls setContact.\n\nI don't think I was super clear, but hopefully it helps.

Do the excersises at least up until this point on Scrimba, you won't regret it. The platform is so cool. I know I'm gonna relearn then learn a lot already.\n\nIf you are a beginner, make sure you have at least a medium-well grasp of ES6 syntax. It will help a lot when having to remember Vanilla JS methods. I took a minute to remember createElement myself, because React just makes it so easy. It's simply a function with a return block that contains the HTML you want executed and the querySelector - not JS but JSX style. That's the advantage of using this awesome *declarative* language where it's easier to type exactly what you mean. *Imperative* Vanilla JS takes many more instructions and you have be very explicit, wasting time.\n\nBreaking things up is one of the first things you learn, and that *component architecture* allows you to break up into chunks that are semantically similar. This comes in handy so that the main element doesn't contain every bit of code but rather references to said code.\n\nReact is a great langauge that is well maintained and the market is saturated with React positions (although the downside is everyone will be lfor those positions, especially bootcamp grads).\n\nTake the 5 minutes to download Node and npm and set up your editor if you haven't at the step where Bob points that out. It's nice to get used to the file architecture, the imports, and bascially the whole enviroment in Create React App. Also make sure you did the setup at 1:51:43 and that you have the right images files and stuff from the React site.\n\nNext time I'll build the React Info App.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Brooks Gunn", "text": "@Gihan Kavinda Thanks man.
