The participant calls its \"send\" method which will use the chatroom's \"send\" method to call all of the other participants \"receive\" method. This way participants don't need to store any information about other participants, the chatroom (mediator) will be responsible for mediating this communication.\n\nIn the pubsub pattern we always have an event bus taking care of all events and handlers that are registered to it, and it is also a mediator. The difference is that the pubsub is done specifically to deal with events, where an object can subscribe to any event with a handler, and another completely different object can also subscribe to an event or fire one that was subscribed by other objects. Objects have no idea of how many other objects are subscribed to the event they are firing (just like participants have no idea of other participants in the chat room), and also objects have no idea of who's firing the event they're subscribing to. The responsibility of the event bus (mediator) is to properly handle these events by calling the proper callbacks attached to them.\n\nAnd the observer pattern, which can also be confusing in the middle of these, is almost the same as the pubsub (pubsub is actually derived from the subscriber pattern), the difference being that while using pubsub we have a very loose coupling between objects due to the event bus being the one handling all the events, and in the observer pattern we have a tight coupling because the observer object always knows about the subject it's observing to (exactly how we do natively using the DOM API to listen to elements events).", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz6wzE6xMAWdF6RjZV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-12-06T02:06:38Z", "author": "Mr Valdes", "text": "Exactly the same example from Brad Traversy udemy course for the pattern.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugz6wzE6xMAWdF6RjZV4AaABAg.8oVKduIanDa8oWqwet8JmT", "publishedAt": "2018-12-06T16:16:47Z", "author": "Mr Valdes", "text": "@freeCodeCamp.org i see, thanks", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugz6wzE6xMAWdF6RjZV4AaABAg.8oVKduIanDa8oWpDGy67c4", "publishedAt": "2018-12-06T16:01:43Z", "author": "freeCodeCamp.org", "text": "Must have both gotten from https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/mediator-design-pattern", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwZnUz_7NyUveJktc54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-06-06T01:11:19Z", "author": "Chriss123", "text": "Awesome tutorial - Thanks.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy2NOus85P2msifkf14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-04-13T13:45:31Z", "author": "Fredo Corleone", "text": "This is how various NICs communicate in a subnet", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzC2HPpc1FtOXkbfcJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-02-26T17:02:41Z", "author": "allo", "text": "Very helpful!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz1sgxEHi6YmS-0E6R4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2017-11-17T11:25:20Z", "author": "Jama", "text": "hey guys, I have to develop three design patterns to mobile app, If I use this code, do you think they can find it as an act of plagarism?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzpeYKhSq4htAI7SJF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2017-11-08T12:55:51Z", "author": "Cyril ViXP", "text": "Looks like the less flexible implementation of Observer pattern", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzpeYKhSq4htAI7SJF4AaABAg.8ZhYY3M2YV-95OxATnHmct", "publishedAt": "2020-02-24T00:02:25Z", "author": "wakamoto1105", "text": "I was thinking the same thing...
