One day your heart will stop beating and you will be dead! The Bible says you\u2019ll then be judged by the holy and righteous God who created this universe.(Hebrew 9:27)You\u2019ll be judged for every word, thought, and action in your life.(Matthew 12:36-37) Will you be innocent or guilty?\r\n\r\n*Let\u2019s check the standard, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever lied (even a \u201cwhite\u201d lie)? (Revelation 21:8) Have you ever stolen anything (value is irrelevant and includes downloading or copying movies illegally)?  If you\u2019ve lusted, you\u2019ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve hated someone, the Bible says you\u2019re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you\u2019ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. God is perfect and He hates sin, but He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the Cross to take the punishment you deserve. Then He rose from the graves after three days  \u2013 defeating death. (Luke 24:46-48)\r\n\r\nRepent (turn from your sins) and trust in Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour  to receive forgiveness and everlasting life afterlife here on earth without pain, suffering and death anymore (revelation 21:4) God cannot Lie He is holy, Righteous and just cannot tolerate Sin(Hebrew 6:18) if you don\u2019t believe in God you are making God a liar. Think about it.\r\n\r\nDo you think God cannot preserve His words ? He created the heaven and the earth and the sea all living things here on earth including human.\r\n\r\n. Read the Bible to learn about God and how to live. (Acts 20:21) \r\n\r\n*Do God\u2019s will, plan and purpose in your life; these are above and beyond, immeasurable compare to your grandest dream.\r\n\r\n* We obey God\u2019s moral law the Ten Commandments because we love our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, the Father and the Holy Ghost(John 14:15) (John 14:1-6) (John 14:16-26) (Mark 12:30-31)  with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength, and we believe and have faith in Him; also we Fear Him with reverence with deep respect. \r\n\r\nJob 28:28\r\nKing James Version\r\n28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10\r\nNew King James Version\r\n9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. (A)Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [a]homosexuals, nor [b]sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastes 12:13-14\r\nNew King James Version\r\n13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:\r\n\r\n(A)Fear God and keep His commandments,\r\nFor this is man\u2019s all.\r\n14 For (B)God will bring every work into judgment,\r\nIncluding every secret thing,\r\nWhether good or evil.\r\n\r\n* Let\u2019s seek the Lord and His face also His strength, power, wisdom and discernment in our daily lives.\r\n\r\nWe need God\u2019s help to overcome Sin in our lives. And live a holy life in the eyes of the Living God. \r\n\r\nGod will help us if we seek Him diligently with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength .\r\n\r\nPut on always the full armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)\r\n\r\nPhilippians 4:13\r\nNew King James Version\r\n13 I can do all things (A)through [a]Christ who strengthens me.\r\n\r\nPsalm 28:7\r\nNew King James Version\r\n7 The Lord is (A)my strength and my shield;\r\nMy heart (B)trusted in Him, and I am helped;\r\nTherefore my heart greatly rejoices,\r\nAnd with my song I will praise Him.\r\n\r\nGod bless.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiving water.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyiauTNe48Os03DVJR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-02T20:51:58Z", "author": "Emelia Oppong", "text": "This course was done in 2018.
