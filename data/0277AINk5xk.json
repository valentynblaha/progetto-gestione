I'd say about 90-ish% of the time, I work 9am - 5pm, Mon-Fri. If I work beyond that window, it's usually completely self-imposed because that's the kind of problem-solver I am and will sometimes be close to fixing an annoying bug or making the next big milestone in my project. I also work with teams outside the US, so I like to queue up things for them to look at during their normal business hours, which is when I'm in bed. A lot of my co-workers are like this, but usually when we get someone new, I try to tell them \"this is just how I am. Work the hours that are comfortable for you\".\n\nThe one thing that is important, is if you decide on a time-frame in which you work, stick with it. You'll have to attend meetings, and people will need to know what hours you work so they can account for that in their planning. It's not helpful if your work schedule is all over the place. I have a co-worker, really talented guy, who works 7am - 3pm. Everyone knows this, and he's consistent, so it's no problem.

The company is impossibly huge, it's not ridiculous to think maybe there are some unhappy employees somewhere. In my office specifically, I've never seen it as toxic. The work can be a little tough and stressful at times, but this is to be expected at the scale we work on. But my manager is a stronger advocate for the well-being of her engineers. If she notices I've worked late several times in a week, she'll very plainly tell me to take a day off. Our teams are constantly growing in an effort to make sure fewer people experience pain or burnout from being overworked. My team in particular is really new (it was formed late last year, and I joined from another team); so there will be some growing pains. Fortunately, we have a strong sister team to back us up, and we've learned a lot from other teams and what they had to go through. The company has been doing things on the inside to help hold teams accountable for the happiness of the people working on them, so there's that. I can't really talk about what they are, but they seem to be really effective so far. \n\nNo one wants to encourage a toxic work environment. It's extremely costly to the company when people leave. Not just financially, but it hurts the company's public image. Managers experience a lot of pain from poorly-designed teams (remember, *they* have to report to someone, too), and folks leaving makes the pain worse: it's not a trivial matter to hire new people, and get them up to speed and contributing.\n\nIf you have an interview, just ask each person you meet with about their experiences. We are very well aware of the articles and reviews floating around and want to make sure we don't bullshit candidates. Any good interviewer should plan a slice of time for you to ask questions. I *always* make time for candidates to ask questions.", "likes": 10}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sanjay Shr", "text": "How do I get hired at amazon ?.", "likes": 11}, "replies": [{"author": "Yash Verma", "text": "Trees -> graphs \u2014> Dynamic programming -> Amazon sde.!!!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "FBA2920", "text": "This isnt true.

You need to answer the coding question that fits with their 14th principles.
