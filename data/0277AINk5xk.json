The company is impossibly huge, it's not ridiculous to think maybe there are some unhappy employees somewhere. In my office specifically, I've never seen it as toxic. The work can be a little tough and stressful at times, but this is to be expected at the scale we work on. But my manager is a stronger advocate for the well-being of her engineers. If she notices I've worked late several times in a week, she'll very plainly tell me to take a day off. Our teams are constantly growing in an effort to make sure fewer people experience pain or burnout from being overworked. My team in particular is really new (it was formed late last year, and I joined from another team); so there will be some growing pains. Fortunately, we have a strong sister team to back us up, and we've learned a lot from other teams and what they had to go through. The company has been doing things on the inside to help hold teams accountable for the happiness of the people working on them, so there's that. I can't really talk about what they are, but they seem to be really effective so far. \n\nNo one wants to encourage a toxic work environment. It's extremely costly to the company when people leave. Not just financially, but it hurts the company's public image. Managers experience a lot of pain from poorly-designed teams (remember, *they* have to report to someone, too), and folks leaving makes the pain worse: it's not a trivial matter to hire new people, and get them up to speed and contributing.\n\nIf you have an interview, just ask each person you meet with about their experiences. We are very well aware of the articles and reviews floating around and want to make sure we don't bullshit candidates. Any good interviewer should plan a slice of time for you to ask questions. I *always* make time for candidates to ask questions.", "likes": 10}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugh9RLBHVURtXXgCoAEC", "publishedAt": "2017-05-12T19:44:40Z", "author": "Sanjay Shr", "text": "How do I get hired at amazon ?.", "likes": 11}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugh9RLBHVURtXXgCoAEC.8STnElaN6ax8yNv7eENgKM", "publishedAt": "2019-08-08T18:14:09Z", "author": "Yash Verma", "text": "Trees -> graphs \u2014> Dynamic programming -> Amazon sde.!!!", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugh9RLBHVURtXXgCoAEC.8STnElaN6ax8eubnvgSWxx", "publishedAt": "2018-04-11T17:51:36Z", "author": "FBA2920", "text": "This isnt true.

They gave you a vague answer because they are just guessing. Not like any other big tech companies, Amazon does not focus greatly on the technical skills when they interview you for a job. Don't get me wrong. You do need to know how to solve the coding problem on a white board. But most of their questions focus on their 14th leadership principles. You need to answer the coding question that fits with their 14th principles. And you need experiences or graduated from a well-known university (Stanford, Berkeley, Carnegie mellon etc) in order to be considered for an interview.
