The code for adding the items to the cart doesn't appear to work, it inhibits the cart toggle if I comment out the code the cart toggle function works, is there a fix for this?\n2.

Enough of these styles videos. @Coding Addict you can't have good engagement with your videos when half the code is already written. 100% follow along, or its a copy and paste tutorial.
