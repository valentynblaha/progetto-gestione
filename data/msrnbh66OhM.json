You did a good job in general. You need to rewrite the introduction copy. It's not reading well. I'ts not clear what you want to say. \"I like performance as much as much as expertise?\" Why would you want to say that anyway? What you can say is \"I have the expertise to build a well performing site.\" The capitalization throughout is wrong. You can't have a question mark at the end of a sentence and then start another sentence with a lower case letter. You might be at a disadvantage if English is not your home language, but it's crucial you get the grammar right.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Marcin Ko\u0142odziej", "text": "Just 2 cents from me - I think this menu is taken from the Jonas Schmedtmann's CSS course.
