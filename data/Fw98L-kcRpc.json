I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called \u201cFischer Random Chess,\u201d where the starting position of the pieces is \u201crandomized\u201d to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0\r\n\r\nBIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Kuncoro Jatikusumo", "text": "what is the difference between User Stories and Problem Statement?

Even if this was not the standard explanation, I liked it so much that I will frame my thoughts around this: Personas -> Epics -> Set of User Stories. \n\nIt helped too to think of a user story with this structure:\n\n\"As a <Pet Owner>, \n\nI want to <showcase my pet to other pet owners>, \n\nso that <we can setup play dates for our dogs>\n\nNote: The <we can setup play dates for our dogs> has to WORK with the target audience (the audience looking online to setup dog play dates with this app etc.)\n\nAnd, lastly, Epics can contain many related stories for this audience (audience coming to this app to find other dogs for theirs to play with).  For example, there can be another user story to validate dog sitters. So an EPIC that covers both user stories could be (like the title of a book), \"Allow pet owners to socialize their dogs better, even when they are busy professionals\"\n\nLoved it!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Gary knight", "text": "Straight to the point!
