Causual tuto are to easy : a variable is... or to hard import panda and make you confortable with it...\n\nI'm not familiar with Python, I'd done some scripts but nothing fancy, mostly converting csv to xlsx, by installing librabry with pip, and other stuffs with string and calling bash utillity. \n\nAnd for instance if I understood pretty easily we import EmailMessage for sending mai (genius)l, I'd like also to know how you I can find easily what I need in python doc, or other informative sources experienced people know about.
