{"video": {"id": "K2qjAixgLqk", "title": "Reinforcement Learning Course: Intro to Advanced Actor Critic Methods", "description": "Actor critic methods are used in machine learning. They are most useful for applications in robotics as they allow us to output continuous, rather than discrete actions. This enables control of electric motors to actuate movement in robotic systems, at the expense of increased computational complexity.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Code for the algorithms covered:\n\ud83d\udd17 Actor Critic: https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/actor_critic/tensorflow2\n\ud83d\udd17 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/DDPG/tensorflow2/pendulum\n\ud83d\udd17 Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/TD3/tf2\n\ud83d\udd17 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/PPO/torch\n\ud83d\udd17 Soft Actor Critic (SAC): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/SAC/tf2\n\ud83d\udd17 Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/A3C/pytorch\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course from Phil Tabor.

And if actually they would be random, how is the agent  learning?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tarif Cemay", "text": "I thought prob_ratio must equal to one if we replay the same action as the actor is updated after replay . am I right?", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Muhammad Aariz Marzuq", "text": "wish i found this earlier UwU", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Trenton Spears", "text": "Oohhh sweet!
