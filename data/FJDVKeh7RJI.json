{"video": {"id": "FJDVKeh7RJI", "title": "React & TypeScript - Course for Beginners", "description": "Learn how to build React apps using TypeScript. First, learn the basics of TypeScript. Then, learn how to integrate TypeScript in a React app by building an awesome project. You will learn how to use TypeScript with React Hooks such as useState, useRef, and useReducers. You will also learn how to pass props from one component to another by defining prop types of the component. And you will learn much more!\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Roadside Coder.

Very little is actually explained , it's very much a case of  \"just do it like this\" without any explanation of why it's being done that way. There is an infuriating part where the presenter asks the viewer \" why do we have type and interfaces when they aer very similar\" and then goes on to continue explaining how similar they are without ever answering the question!  \nThere are also some bad practices in here - for example passing the entire todos array as a prop to each single Todo component.  A single todo element does not need to know about the other todos. instead, the edit, delete, isDone functions should be declared in the TodoList component and passed to the todo components as props. At the end of the day it's free and I'm grateful for that but the quality is not great.", "likes": 77}, "replies": [{"author": "XarbyX", "text": "this mean no need to watch the tutorial and just ignore it to avoid confusions?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "DOPETAG", "text": "Wow!
