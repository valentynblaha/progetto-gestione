There is very little typescript in this course -it's almost entirely React. Very little is actually explained , it's very much a case of  \"just do it like this\" without any explanation of why it's being done that way. There is an infuriating part where the presenter asks the viewer \" why do we have type and interfaces when they aer very similar\" and then goes on to continue explaining how similar they are without ever answering the question!  \nThere are also some bad practices in here - for example passing the entire todos array as a prop to each single Todo component.  A single todo element does not need to know about the other todos. instead, the edit, delete, isDone functions should be declared in the TodoList component and passed to the todo components as props. At the end of the day it's free and I'm grateful for that but the quality is not great.", "likes": 86}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugwid-mqK9Fi4mgNX-Z4AaABAg.9_KDH8Z7zgB9kZ3UFldsut", "publishedAt": "2023-01-06T20:17:14Z", "author": "Quoc Lam", "text": "I especially felt this at the drag and drop portion", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugwid-mqK9Fi4mgNX-Z4AaABAg.9_KDH8Z7zgB9f29cSZiqgh", "publishedAt": "2022-08-22T18:59:01Z", "author": "Unsent PH", "text": "this mean no need to watch the tutorial and just ignore it to avoid confusions?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugwid-mqK9Fi4mgNX-Z4AaABAg.9_KDH8Z7zgB9ddmHVUmoYY", "publishedAt": "2022-07-19T01:53:54Z", "author": "DOPETAG", "text": "Wow!
