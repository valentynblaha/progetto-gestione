But JS is an IL, and that needs a IL-layers that interprets values all the time, constant reflection. The closest you can get that to be performant in any way, is forcing TypeScript, so that the WebAssembly compilers can pack everything to a stack that's memory reliable.    But using JS for game development is hardly what the language was made for, it's not even typed or geared for classes, not to mention that setting up a data-oriented tech stack is close to impossible. Just like a hammer wasn't made for screwing in a screw, using JS for game development is certainly misusing the tool for its intended use-case.    My point being that learning other tools for game-development will make the job (in the grand scheme of a project) easier for the builder, just like learning to use a screw-driver is easier when working with screws (Even though screw-drivers may seem intimidating when all one has ever used is a hammer).", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Franks laboratory", "text": "HTML canvas was made specifically for projects like this, it was made for animated web games and interactive graphs.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tai Kolawole", "text": "Wow this is classic love your explanations", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "READ MY CHANNEL BANNER FOR FREE IPHONE 14", "text": "1:42 This is why you're my favorite youtuber lol", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "CHECK MY CHANNEL BANNER FOR FREE IPHONE 14", "text": "Let's take a moment to appreciate how much time and effort he puts into his content for us.

Moreover - you don't need to change even the arguments of state classes constructors, since you  pass the \"player\" object reference to every state instance you create inside it. And your \"player\" object already has the \"game\" object reference. All you need to do - is to create a \"game\" field inside parental class (State class). You even can simplify the code, removing all \"this.player = player\" statements from inherited class constructors to parental constructor:\n\r\nclass State {\r\n    constructor(state, player) {\r\n        this.state = state;\r\n        this.player = player;\n        this.game = player.game;\r\n    }\r\n}\n\nclass Sitting | Running | ... | Rolling extends State {\n    constructor(player) {\n        super(\"SITTING\" | \"RUNNING\" | ... | \"ROLLING\", player);\n    }\n}\n\r\nthus you can leave \"this.player\" inside all inherited classes as is, getting rid of \"this.player = player\" statement in all inherited state classes at the same time. In addition, now nothing needs to be changed in the \"player\" class. \nAnd a cherry on the cake - you also get rid of the errror in the \"handleInput\", because when calling \"this.currentState.enter()\" your current state will already have the \"player\" reference, hence \"this.player.frameX = 0\" will not cause an error.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "bedwarssolo pro", "text": "1:43", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "bedwarssolo pro", "text": "7:14", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Raven Squad", "text": "They helped!

In this case, the time in the game is set by the total number of frames. By changing the speed, you recalculate the total number of frames each time. The game jumps to a new position in the timeline, and the background layers jump to new coordinate positions corresponding to the game's position in the timeline. To save the current coordinates of the background layers, you need to save the position of the game on the timeline. In other words, when changing the speed, it is necessary to save the total number of frames. Because the total number of frames depends on the number of the \"gameFrame\" and on the \"gameSpeed\" then when changing the speed, it is necessary to change the \"gameFrame\" inversely proportionally to the change in speed. In the context of the code, this is just one line in the \"onchange\" event handler function of the slider, where you need to get the new number of the \"gameFrame\" by simply dividing the total number of frames by the new speed value:\n\n gameFrame = (gameFrame * gameSpeed) / e.target.value;\n\nImportant: you must place this line of code at the very beginning of the handler function, where the \"gameSpeed\" \u200b\u200bvariable remains its value until the speed is changed. I have checked this solution, it works perfectly.", "likes": 11}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0431 \u041f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e", "text": "Hello! At 1:00:05 - in the line 27 \"... - gameSpeed\" is redundant. In the line 25 it's ok, because at the moment when you move the background x1 ahead the background x2, using the x2 value as an offset, x2 keeps the value from the previous iteration, so you have to subtract one more \"gameSpeed\" value from the x1, because in current iteration the background x2 hasn't made \"gameSpeed\" step, but when you move the background x2 ahead the background x1, you concatenate it with x1 in the same iteration, specifically when the background  x1 has already made a gameSpeed step to the left. This will work correctly only when both if statements are in a row, and after them both expressions for calculating the x coordinate as at 1:08:02, because in this case both x1 and x2 still contain values from the previous iteration.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Marta Pfahl", "text": "For everyone who is seeing this, if you want to practice your object oriented programming skills, this tutorial is really really good for that!", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "brian N.47", "text": "hello am stuck at 6:54 i get 'requestAniamtionFrame is not defined'  error someone help", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Chijioke Ogbuanya", "text": "I finished It!\nThanks, Frankie!\nTook me weeks because I didn't want to miss anything, and I didn't!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mystical Abed", "text": "WHy use javascript for game development and not unity?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Michael Williams", "text": "Anyone else having trouble coding this one up? ;_;", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Funny Gamer LOL", "text": "What is the platform  on the left where you can enter the JavaScript and CSS?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Logan Magnuson", "text": "Just finished the course from beginning to end.
