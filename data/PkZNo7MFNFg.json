In Javascript, it's possible to both assign a value to a variable and compare the result, all in the same operation, such as in: if (var=other) { ... }\nIn that case, the value in \"other\" is assigned to \"var\" and if \"other\" is non-zero, then the expression evaluates to TRUE so the commands inside the curly braces are done, but if \"other\" is zero then the commands are skipped.  This is why the == operator is required in order to say \"compare these two instead of assigning one to the other.\"  I started out with BASIC in which you can't both assign and compare at the same time, which means that the single equals sign is contextual and can be either an assignment operator or a comparison operator.\nIn the BASIC version I started out with, variables had to be \"typed\" as either numeric or string, and if you wanted to treat a string of digits as a number, it had to be explicitly converted to a number first.  There was no automatic conversion as in Javascript, therefore no need for the === (strict comparison) operator, since all comparisons were strict.\n\nJavascript is very \"forgiving\" in some areas such as variable typing, but this makes it more complicated in other areas since you as the programmer need to think carefully about exactly what you're telling the computer to do.\nMost programming errors involve the programmer mistakenly telling the computer to do the wrong thing.  Most \"debugging\" involves finding out where the mistake was made and correcting it.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxNNGBWbhRyGoMlPjZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-19T20:49:05Z", "author": "Kojo Daniels", "text": "i cant seem to locate the javascript project tutorials link he mentioned in the video.

Storing a function inside a variable you touch on a little bit but what the heck is this even mean\n\nconst increment = (function()\r\n{\r\n    return function increment(number, value = 1) \r\n    {\r\n        return number + value;\r\n    }\r\n})();\n\nYou never come close to explaining it and just ignore the entire new concept and go \"anyways this is how you set default params\"\n\nWhere is return function increment coming from if we havent made it yet? Is that the same as const increment? If so why are you just then creating the params for it and not in the beginning when you called it a function. Also why does it have parathesis before the function and at the end WITH the param () symbols making it look like the entire thing is a function.\n\nI have so many questions and its confusing. I have no idea what to look up or research as you just jumped the gun on that, how am I the first to see this?\n\nEDIT- If anyone is stuck research IIFE Javascript.

Imagine it as trying to ado a calculation in math class and your teacher says: add x to 4  . You can\u2019t do much because you don\u2019t know what x is.But if he assigns an empty string (output = \u201c\u201d)  the computer sees this as a value and will not give an error. So to sum up you can\u2019t add an undefined variabel to anything. You can assign it to something but you can\u2019t use it to add it to something that is why you need to set it to an empty String\nNext : Why are fun1 and fun2 outside of function ? They are not. They are functions. If you look at the name of the functions you can see they are called fun2 and fun1 what he is doing below is just him calling the methods in order to excecute them. Functions never excecute until you \u201ccall\u201d them. You can call a method by typing it\u2019s name ( for example fun2) and parentheses afterwards. Example : fun2(); \n.", "likes": 20}, {"id": "UgwHOOkeBKOS5ZTGHZx4AaABAg.9OIETae-S8j9TTbkjljrqX", "publishedAt": "2021-10-14T08:04:55Z", "author": "Sameen Ishraq", "text": "even i got confused at that part but I decided to skip it and then come back after I finished the rest of the course", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxThQxD6qGbvLwGD5F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-07T14:25:10Z", "author": "Hr meheraj", "text": "Hello there, I'm from Bangladesh.

Just my opinion, but it seems like 99% of videos are formatted this way which really sucks because I learned a lot of coding from YouTube and now it seems that I've outgrown it and I'm not sure where I can find free visual tutorials.

While both are declarations and value assignments, var and cons are different, no only on scope but also the way the interpreter interprets the assignments, the first one is mutable while the second isn't. Then why are you calling a const variable? The other point that called my attention on this vid, is the jumping on the code snips used as samples. If functions haven't been covered, why are you jumping to functions in the very beginning of the course? I have seen this in many courses, always repeating the same phrase, \"we will cover it later\". If it is a progressive learning, then, base the exercise on what it has been taught so far.

Now that I am almost 30 I am coding again and  much calmer. While I still get that hair raising discomfort and anxiety, understanding that feeling helped me move past it.\n\nI'm going to take a guess and say that you are a creative person; you like to see and understand big pictures and systems as a whole. I'm guessing that because I am similar and get the same kind of repulsion to numbers and logic regardless of my personal competency to do the work.  \n\nThat discomfort and anxiety is a product of left right brain conflict and it's the same discomfort that people who are left brain dominant feel when you tell them 'you just do it' when explaining how to draw a picture or ride a bicycle. \n\nScientists have verified over and over again using split-brain and intact brain patients to prove that we actually have two minds that process different kinds of information, one processes information linearly (a then b then c or 1 then 2 then 3, etc) and the other processes information *relatively* (this related to that, near related to far, etc). Depending on our temperament  we all favor one and in most people one of those brains is a big bully taking on task they shouldn't (the main culprit of drawing seeming like magic to the untrained). \n\nSo when I feel that anxiety and confusion and repulsion, that weird itchy feeling going up my spine and arms, I know that my brains are being uncooperative. \n\nThere is good news: \n\nFirst, coding gets easier to conceptualize as it gets more complex. There's a lot of basics to establish, but once you get past the tedium you can work almost purely  in relative terms that require little to no math or proofs on your part using Object Oriented programming.  \n\nSecond, putting coding aside, if you can push through that aversion and master switching between logic mode and relative mode you will be beyond capable of any artistic or scholastic pursuit you want. I wish I had a reference that went into detail about triggering logic mode, but I love the book 'Drawing with the Right Side of the Brain' as it's very informative as far as being able to switch in and out of right-brain mode.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck and I hope you find satisfaction in your pursuits.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzpkottfU5YtoQlAbt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-20T21:09:40Z", "author": "BroccRR", "text": "oh god this is 3 hours long... why am i this dedicated", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzk-EOiDkffevmcupJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-20T13:15:41Z", "author": "LoQueTuQuierasMajo", "text": "Everytime you say freecode my brain hears freecoke", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy5dMfJFIF_1c4BOKF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-20T04:54:34Z", "author": "Tarun Aggarwal", "text": "Very bad lecture", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzXJHV00CJSKB8cM9Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-19T18:32:26Z", "author": "Faisal ahamed Rahat", "text": "where can i find the 2nd part of the course on ES6?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzCpsZjK2D2QRHHVAJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-19T13:16:52Z", "author": "Mike Prince", "text": "amazing\uff01", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy3DEY53GMHawQcc3B4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-19T12:43:21Z", "author": "S73A gaming", "text": "4:23", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwbyWGVgfk8MLQ4X154AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-19T11:47:48Z", "author": "Priti Shala", "text": "36:28", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgybB6w9-MerqvIy9wl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-19T11:40:51Z", "author": "Summer Stream", "text": "Okay, learning js step 1: install the thing\nStep 2: I am a string 12:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------: I am a string", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxoNa2duTTOMAm8j094AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-19T04:01:28Z", "author": "Thenga Kola", "text": "ads every 2 minutes", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz8qqY4Bx7anoMTqY94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-19T00:34:28Z", "author": "Rajesh Singh", "text": "Ofcourse it has helped me a loads!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgygKzE-aQldt_DvgfN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-18T10:16:52Z", "author": "Priti Shala", "text": "guyes pls dint mind the timings i put in comment its how i bookmark how much i have seen in the vid", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyN0rlCY0mwBjji2vd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-18T10:15:53Z", "author": "Priti Shala", "text": "33:26", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw8sFAeLbwx_k6eE3h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-18T09:42:45Z", "author": "Priti Shala", "text": "31:13", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxmYJQ-um2r_PwE3094AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-18T06:36:16Z", "author": "Priti Shala", "text": "19:24", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxQdd8reSq6qHLUjTh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-18T01:05:57Z", "author": "James M", "text": "For 2:00:56 coding challenge:\n\nvar collection = {\r\n    \"2548\": {\r\n        'album': 'Slippery When Wet',\r\n        'artist': 'Bon Jovi',\r\n        'tracks': [\r\n            'Let It Rock',\r\n            'You Give Love a Bad Name'\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"2468\" : {\r\n        'album': '1999',\r\n        'artist': 'Prince',\r\n        'tracks': [\r\n            '1999',\r\n            'Little Red Corvette'\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"1245\" : {\r\n        'artist': 'Robert Palmer',\r\n        'tracks': [ ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"5439\" : {\r\n        'album': 'ABBA Gold'\r\n    }\r\n}", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxKTrBslHVEoUlva194AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-17T19:42:50Z", "author": "Zack Viccaji", "text": "What should i do after watching this video?

What you are referring to is console.log(increment( )) I believe?\n\nWhat you are looking at is the function increment() being passed as a value into the function console.log(). It will basically report to the console (the output screen) whatever outputs the function inside console.log returns from the variables we put in. The 2nd closed parenthesis belongs with the parenthesis after console.log.  \n\nPassing functions as variables through other functions is a very powerful tool that can allow you to set complex parameters cleanly and can be very powerful with loops.

If you are not using this video as a refresher course, its going to be a hard watch. In his \"objects\" section, he explains what an object is, but doesn't mention that it can also be called a key. At the end of the objects section, with the coding challenge, he uses the term key. The little things are what's making this video a bit confusing at times. It may or may not throw absolute beginners off. Just gotta be really conscious of each word this guy says. This is also not to say that this name calling is that important, but if you were to branch off to other resources, just be prepared to be loose with some of the terms you learn here.", "likes": 0}},

It looks like this:\n\nconst half = (function() {\n    return function half({ max, min }) {\n        return (max + min) / 2.0;\n    };\n})();\n\nThe first question is why is the function written this way?  In other words, why return the results of a second function instead of putting the parameters in directly and returning the results of the operation.  Like this:\n\nconst half = function({ max, min }) {\n    return (max + min) / 2.0;\n};\n\nor as an arrow function like this: const half = ({ max, min }) => (max + min) / 2.0;\n\nA response would be appreciated to help me understand if there is something needed in the original method.

If I spot the part where he explains this, (if there is one) I will take this comment down, and I don't and yet find an error in my script, I will edit this. You may have already figured this all out already, but I'll list it in case. *You may now click \"Read More.\"* \n-----\nI am also very sorry if this is a bit too much to understand. I was coding a website right before this.\n-----\nQuick example (I'm pretty sure) of adding *added* strings together without the \"+=\" method:\nvar numOne = \"First. \" + \"Second.\";\nvar numTwo = \"Third.\" + \"Fourth.\"\nvar numThree = numOne + numTwo\nconsole.log(numThree)\n\n\nI'm pretty sure the console's response would be: \"First.

The golf score example and other examples could also benefit from error capture in a similar way.\n\nCheers!\n\n\nHere's  an example of how it could be caught:  https://scrimba.com/c/cLvZJQfZ\n\nfunction testSize(val) {\n    if (val < 5) {\n        return \"Tiny\";\n    } else if (val < 10) {\n        return \"Small\";\n    } else if (val < 15) {\n        return \"Medium\";\n    } else if (val < 20) {\n        return \"Large\";\n    } else if (val >= 20) {\n        return \"Huge\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Beep\"; // Not a number - undefined    \n    }\n}\nconsole.log(testSize(NaN)); // returns Beep.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxggU599ACuqU1UqVl4AaABAg.8rcX06Gmy3g8sMcidsySy3", "publishedAt": "2019-03-12T03:05:43Z", "author": "solomon michael", "text": "@Laughter On Water Thanks for this.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzKRwPDnJ_gwyK1Lzp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-02-21T19:32:36Z", "author": "Recursive Triforce", "text": "1:29:25 Better is \n\nelse {\nreturn names[par-strokes+2];\n}\n\nor maybe even:\n\nelse if (strokes-par<=HOW_HIGH_THE_NAMES_GO) {\nreturn \"undefined\";\n} else {\nreturn names[par-strokes+2];\n}", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgybMmjRw0K6yYLjGFR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-02-21T11:29:35Z", "author": "Nobody", "text": "If your watching youtube on the streets and a coder jumps into you and say \"var You = 0\"\nTranslation: Lets hack this *****!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwH8PdYwcqY9FAY6jV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-02-21T08:27:32Z", "author": "46Min Htet OO", "text": "Thank you so much.

I wouldn't necessarily say that all religions are man made and fake. Yes, more or less religions are all founded my man, but they aren't fake. Rather they worship God in the ways they see fit based on the religious texts they have. The reason we have many diverse religions is because of the different texts people use to guide them in their worship. There are other things such as traditions and ways of worship but I'll just scratch the surface. Ever since Jesus was crucified and then the Apostles were killed off, the true church of Christ was lost, but people still did try to revive it according to their interpretations of the Bible and traditions they were taught by their parents and religious leaders. I wouldn't go out and blatantly say to someone, \"your religion is fake, false, and irrelevant\". They simply have a different point of view on the matter of religion and belief.
