For example, sometimes the example in the demonstration does not use the most simple use case. A solution would be to provide a more simplified use case first.

In Javascript, it's possible to both assign a value to a variable and compare the result, all in the same operation, such as in: if (var=other) { ... }\nIn that case, the value in \"other\" is assigned to \"var\" and if \"other\" is non-zero, then the expression evaluates to TRUE so the commands inside the curly braces are done, but if \"other\" is zero then the commands are skipped.  This is why the == operator is required in order to say \"compare these two instead of assigning one to the other.\"  I started out with BASIC in which you can't both assign and compare at the same time, which means that the single equals sign is contextual and can be either an assignment operator or a comparison operator.\nIn the BASIC version I started out with, variables had to be \"typed\" as either numeric or string, and if you wanted to treat a string of digits as a number, it had to be explicitly converted to a number first.  There was no automatic conversion as in Javascript, therefore no need for the === (strict comparison) operator, since all comparisons were strict.\n\nJavascript is very \"forgiving\" in some areas such as variable typing, but this makes it more complicated in other areas since you as the programmer need to think carefully about exactly what you're telling the computer to do.\nMost programming errors involve the programmer mistakenly telling the computer to do the wrong thing.  Most \"debugging\" involves finding out where the mistake was made and correcting it.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Kojo Daniels", "text": "i cant seem to locate the javascript project tutorials link he mentioned in the video.

Is that the same as const increment? If so why are you just then creating the params for it and not in the beginning when you called it a function. Also why does it have parathesis before the function and at the end WITH the param () symbols making it look like the entire thing is a function.\n\nI have so many questions and its confusing. I have no idea what to look up or research as you just jumped the gun on that, how am I the first to see this?\n\nEDIT- If anyone is stuck research IIFE Javascript. Basically, he's making an anonymous function and then running it at the same time its made.\n\nSo 1. If it wasnt assinged to const increment it would create and run once then you couldnt use it again. \n2. Yeah its running the function as soon as its created and inside the function is another function that returns a value so he has the entire function return so increment = the value of everything done there.\n\nSo if you want it to make more sense you can do this \n\nconst increment2 = (number, value = 1) => number + value;\n\n\nor \n\nfunction increment3(number, value = 1)\n{\n\u00a0 \u00a0 return number + value;\n}", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "VoidedEyez", "text": "Modify Array Data\n43:34\n\n\nAccess Multi-Dimensional Arrays\n44:48\n\n\npush()\n46:30\n\n\npop()\n47:29\n\n\nshift()\n48:33\n\n\nunshift()\n49:23\n\n\nShopping List\n50:36\n\n\nWrite Reusable with Functions\n51:41\n\n\nArguments\n53:41\n\n\nGlobal Scope\n55:43\n\n\nLocal Scope\n59:31\n\n\nGlobal vs Local Scope in Functions\n1:00:46\n\n\nReturn a Value from a Function\n1:02:40\n\n\nUndefined Value returned\n1:03:55\n\n\nAssignment with a Returned Value\n1:04:52\n\n\nStand in Line\n1:05:52\n\n\nBoolean Values\n1:08:41\n\n\nIf Statements\n1:09:24\n\n\nEquality Operators\n1:11:51\n\n\nAnd / Or Operators\n1:19:17\n\n\nElse Statements\n1:21:37\n\n\nElse If Statements\n1:22:27\n\n\nLogical Order in If Else Statements\n1:23:30\n\n\nChaining If Else Statements\n1:24:45\n\n\nGolf Code\n1:27:45\n\n\nSwitch Statements\n1:32:15\n\n\nReturning Boolean Values from Functions\n1:41:11\n\n\nReturn Early Pattern for Functions\n1:42:20\n\n\nCounting Cards\n1:43:38\n\n\nBuild Objects\n1:49:11\n\n\nDot Notation\n1:50:46\n\n\nBracket Notation\n1:51:33\n\n\nVariables\n1:52:47\n\n\nUpdating Object Properties\n1:53:34\n\n\nAdd New Properties to Object\n1:54:30\n\n\nDelete Properties from Object\n1:55:19\n\n\nObjects for Lookups\n1:55:54\n\n\nTesting Objects for Properties\n1:57:43\n\n\nManipulating Complex Objects\n1:59:15\n\n\nNested Objects\n2:01:00\n\n\nNested Arrays\n2:01:53\n\n\nRecord Collection\n2:03:06\n\n\nWhile Loops\n2:10:15\n\n\nFor Loops\n2:11:35\n\n\nOdd Numbers With a For Loop\n2:13:56\n\n\nCount Backwards With a For Loop\n2:15:28\n\n\nIterate Through an Array with a For Loop\n2:17:08\n\n\nNesting For Loops\n2:19:43\n\n\nDo...While Loops\n2:22:45\n\n\nProfile Lookup\n2:24:12\n\n\nRandom Fractions and Whole Numbers\n2:28:18\n\n\nparseInt Function\n2:31:46\n\n\nTernary Operator\n2:33:29\n\n\nMultiple Ternary Operators\n2:34:57\n\n\nvar vs let\n2:36:57\n\n\nconst Keyword\n2:41:32\n\n\nMutate an Array Declared with const\n2:43:40\n\n\nPrevent Object Mutation\n2:44:52\n\n\nArrow Functions\n2:47:17\n\n\nDefault Parameters\n2:53:04\n\n\nRest Operator\n2:54:00\n\n\nSpread Operator\n2:55:31\n\n\nDestructuring Assignment\n2:57:18\n\n\nTemplate Literals\n3:06:39\n\n\nSimple Fields\n3:10:43\n\n\nDeclarative Functions\n3:12:24\n\n\nclass Syntax\n3:12:56\n\n\ngetters and setters\n3:15:11\n\n\nimport and export\n3:20:25", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "someBODY once told me", "text": "Will there be a Postgres crash course???", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Saptarshi Rudra", "text": "wasn't really helpful.

It took me about a week before I finished the tutorial and I can tell u every bit of that was worth it!", "likes": 23}, {"author": "StarexPlode", "text": "Hm", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Iftekhar Ahmed", "text": "-------------------------------------------------------Description---------------------------------------------------------------------------", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Don Cat", "text": "for some reason the console.log doesnt show anything to me \ud83d\ude29", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "anup_ytc", "text": "Better learn python and come back here..

Two things that could be improved:\n1. It would be better if you could go a bit more into detail with certain topics.

What is unclear to me is why we start function fun2 with 'var output ='' ' (thus, why the empty strings?) and why fun1 and fun2 are outside of the function. As a complete beginner with JavaScript this is all new to me, so it would have been nice if things like that were explained as well. \n2.

He couldn\u2019t just do : var output; because he uses the += operator which is the same as output = output + 1 (output +=1) for example. So now, if he just wrote : var output; the Programm would give an error. This is because the variable doesn\u2019t have a value. Imagine it as trying to ado a calculation in math class and your teacher says: add x to 4  . You can\u2019t do much because you don\u2019t know what x is.But if he assigns an empty string (output = \u201c\u201d)  the computer sees this as a value and will not give an error. So to sum up you can\u2019t add an undefined variabel to anything. You can assign it to something but you can\u2019t use it to add it to something that is why you need to set it to an empty String\nNext : Why are fun1 and fun2 outside of function ? They are not. They are functions. If you look at the name of the functions you can see they are called fun2 and fun1 what he is doing below is just him calling the methods in order to excecute them. Functions never excecute until you \u201ccall\u201d them. You can call a method by typing it\u2019s name ( for example fun2) and parentheses afterwards.

I'm guessing that because I am similar and get the same kind of repulsion to numbers and logic regardless of my personal competency to do the work.  \n\nThat discomfort and anxiety is a product of left right brain conflict and it's the same discomfort that people who are left brain dominant feel when you tell them 'you just do it' when explaining how to draw a picture or ride a bicycle. \n\nScientists have verified over and over again using split-brain and intact brain patients to prove that we actually have two minds that process different kinds of information, one processes information linearly (a then b then c or 1 then 2 then 3, etc) and the other processes information *relatively* (this related to that, near related to far, etc). Depending on our temperament  we all favor one and in most people one of those brains is a big bully taking on task they shouldn't (the main culprit of drawing seeming like magic to the untrained). \n\nSo when I feel that anxiety and confusion and repulsion, that weird itchy feeling going up my spine and arms, I know that my brains are being uncooperative. \n\nThere is good news: \n\nFirst, coding gets easier to conceptualize as it gets more complex. There's a lot of basics to establish, but once you get past the tedium you can work almost purely  in relative terms that require little to no math or proofs on your part using Object Oriented programming.  \n\nSecond, putting coding aside, if you can push through that aversion and master switching between logic mode and relative mode you will be beyond capable of any artistic or scholastic pursuit you want. I wish I had a reference that went into detail about triggering logic mode, but I love the book 'Drawing with the Right Side of the Brain' as it's very informative as far as being able to switch in and out of right-brain mode.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck and I hope you find satisfaction in your pursuits.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "BroccRR", "text": "oh god this is 3 hours long... why am i this dedicated", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "LoQueTuQuierasMajo", "text": "Everytime you say freecode my brain hears freecoke", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tarun Aggarwal", "text": "Very bad lecture", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Faisal ahamed Rahat", "text": "where can i find the 2nd part of the course on ES6?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mike Prince", "text": "amazing\uff01", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "S73A gaming", "text": "4:23", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Priti Shala", "text": "36:28", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Summer Stream", "text": "Okay, learning js step 1: install the thing\nStep 2: I am a string 12:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------: I am a string", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Thenga Kola", "text": "ads every 2 minutes", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rajesh Singh", "text": "Ofcourse it has helped me a loads!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Priti Shala", "text": "guyes pls dint mind the timings i put in comment its how i bookmark how much i have seen in the vid", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Priti Shala", "text": "33:26", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Priti Shala", "text": "31:13", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Priti Shala", "text": "19:24", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "James M", "text": "For 2:00:56 coding challenge:\n\nvar collection = {\r\n    \"2548\": {\r\n        'album': 'Slippery When Wet',\r\n        'artist': 'Bon Jovi',\r\n        'tracks': [\r\n            'Let It Rock',\r\n            'You Give Love a Bad Name'\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"2468\" : {\r\n        'album': '1999',\r\n        'artist': 'Prince',\r\n        'tracks': [\r\n            '1999',\r\n            'Little Red Corvette'\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"1245\" : {\r\n        'artist': 'Robert Palmer',\r\n        'tracks': [ ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"5439\" : {\r\n        'album': 'ABBA Gold'\r\n    }\r\n}", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Zack Viccaji", "text": "What should i do after watching this video?

At the end of the objects section, with the coding challenge, he uses the term key. The little things are what's making this video a bit confusing at times. It may or may not throw absolute beginners off. Just gotta be really conscious of each word this guy says.

Ever since Jesus was crucified and then the Apostles were killed off, the true church of Christ was lost, but people still did try to revive it according to their interpretations of the Bible and traditions they were taught by their parents and religious leaders.
