So, next step, can I deploy this to one of my other machines without doing anything more than adding the secrets and running the yaml scripts (after installing and setting up docker/kubernetes). First, I attempted to do this on my main machine (that is, it's my main developement machine, I used the VS code dev box to follow the tutorial). I spent hours and hours trying to get it to work but to no avail. I thought perhaps it's a configuration issue so I tried it on my laptop, added secrets, both yaml files ran them in ps and it works - no issues. Great, so I finally have a working image in docker hub. Tried again on my dev box and nope, not working (I get an authorisation error in mongo) ready state is always zero. I change nothing and test it again, but this time on my work laptop. Works no problem. \n\nSo the conclusion to me is that somewhere, something is cached, be it the mongo image, the catalog image, the mongo credentials I don't know. (I did remove the images locally and run the yaml files), Google has not helped me this time. The one thing I notice (although I dare say it's a red-herring) the catalog image appears to download almost instantly upon running the catalog.yaml, unlike the mongo image where there is a considerable delay.\n\nAnyway, if anyone has any ideas what may be causing this issue (or maybe they solved it themselves already) it would be greatly appreciated.
