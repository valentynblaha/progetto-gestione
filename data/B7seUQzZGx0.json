For example, a sine wave can be described by a continuous function. Taking samples of a continuous function to represent it results in a lower quality representation, no matter how many sampling points are taken over the interval.", "likes": 5}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "David Castrill\u00f3n", "text": "I think it would be a good idea name the video with a clear title, maybe related to the topic :D", "likes": 3}}]}
