Why? Because it isn't for me, I'm a complete beginner and hardly know anything about python,. The pong tutorial was great! It helped me so much and I hardly made any errors! A small tip for people using pycharm- you don't need to worry about the spaces and tabs, it will work even if it's tabs and not spaces or at least it did for me. Anyway, so I made the pong and it was so helpful but when I started snake I was disappointed, first of all, the game wasn't started from scratch, there was already code written down and I had to copy all of it, trying to pause between his extremely fast scrolling. Then his explanations aren't clear and he tests the game after everything is done which means that if someone makes an error, they'll take forever to figure out where is the error is. Maybe for people who already know python it'll be easy but for beginners like me, totally not recommended", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyneRFjpM_Nb2Dti994AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-15T20:58:07Z", "author": "frodelius", "text": "Thank you for the tutorials!

It doesnt come up always,..I think it correlates with closing the window after stopping the programm. But other times it ocurred when running the program after it already run once. So far I can only solve it by closing spyder and reopen it, then I can run it once and then this error starts ocurring again. It appears that also other people have been having this kind of problems with turtle objects, but I couldnt solve this issue so far. And evidently you are not having it, nor mentioning anything related to it. There is something about the turtle module, the update method and the closing the window that makes trouble. Do you know what I mean and have you had experience with this?\n\nEDIT: Other times I would get the error: \"TclError: invalid command name \".!canvas\". I really have the feeling, that the programm is trying to do something with a window at a point where it doesnt exist anymore or where it already has been destroyed. And I got the feeling that fixing this requires knowledge about object orientated programming. I actually dont understand why it works flawless in your tutorial, but not for me with basically the same code\n\nEDIT: I can see on your screen, that you also get the \"TclError: invalid command name \".!canvas\" message- how does one fix this and why isn't this an issue for you when closing the window and running the code again??! When I close it and wanna run it again it I only have a black canvas, which I then cant even close anymore.

Setting that to 0 sets the ball to to be able to go its maximum speed per update cycle, but doesn't control how much the ball actually moves per cycle.  But the variables ball.dirnx and ball.dirny are the ones that actually control the amount of movement the ball takes per update.  Remember that the loop you set up states 'while True', which is ALWAYS going to be true in this program.  So it will continually going through the loop and since it is asynchronous, thas means that the loop doesn't wait for any of the commands it issues to complete before moving onto the next.  Therefore, with this program the way it is set up, the apparent speed of the ball is determined by the speed of your processor clock, and the only way you can control how fast the ball moves on the screen is through the ball.dirnx and ball.dirny variables.  Therefore faster machines will need smaller dirnx and dirny values.  It also means that if you try to run this on a different computer, or if your computer suddenly has more load on it, your ball will its change its resulting speed.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzIkqfR7nOyumbZ_Kl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-02-21T04:26:42Z", "author": "Ivan Galicia", "text": "Hi, great tutorial.
