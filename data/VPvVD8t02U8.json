It reminds me on (C++) programming books where you have to read 400 pages before you learn what a function is, and 1000 pages to hear about classes. I also don't know about what introduction video he is talking about, I can't find any links so I didn't see how the final application looks and works like. Generally, it seems as if there wasn't that much functionality implemented. I can only imagine that a lot of time was spent on implementing (time consuming) things that I, as a layman, don't understand/realise, but how many people want to know about all these specific (time consuming) things when they just want get going and develop their first basic app?\n\nI don't mean to bash, but considering that this video is 37 hours long (!), I can only assume half the time is spend (or harshly formulated, wasted) on slow talking, \"umm\"-sounds and repeating  information. If I'm not mistaken, it takes him like 90 minutes to get to the point of programming the first line of code and I don't want to know how many hours to get further stuff done. I mean, 5+ hours of this video are spent on setting various \"stuff\" up. Why does setting up Git and GitHub take 50 minutes? That sounds like something that can be explained in like 10-15 minutes. Isn't a splash screen a very simple thing? Then I wonder why it takes 50 minutes to implement it (I'm referring to the chapter timestamps). These are all aspects that make me wonder if this course is worth watching and who it was actually designed for. Definitely not for people who already have any kind of programming experience (in any language). For them the course takes way too much time and things are explained too slowly. If the video was designed for absolute beginners, then why does it take 90 minutes to program the first line of code. I feel like it shouldn't take much more than 20 minutes to get to the point of programming your first line of code, otherwise people get just bored and demotivated? For example, who cares about developer accounts in the beginning anyway? People want to get stuff done! Maybe I would have a different opinion if I actually did the course, but I feel like it would have been better if parts of this video were restructured and everything was condensed so it only took 15 hours.\n\nEither way, I hope I'm not being to harsh. Thanks for making the course (for free!) and I hope it helps many people. Unfortunately, it didn't help me (so far).
