poderosas ora\u00e7\u00f5es que voc\u00ea pode rezar pelas almas do purgat\u00f3rio, que precisam muito delas:\n\n1) Ora\u00e7\u00e3o de Santa Gertrudes\nEterno Pai, Ofere\u00e7o-Vos o Precios\u00edssimo Sangue de Vosso Divino Filho Jesus, em uni\u00e3o com todas as Missas que hoje s\u00e3o celebradas em todo o mundo; por todas as Santas almas do purgat\u00f3rio, pelos pecadores de todos os lugares, pelos pecadores de toda a Igreja, pelos de minha casa e de meus vizinhos. Am\u00e9m.\n\n2) Ora\u00e7\u00e3o para ter um cora\u00e7\u00e3o misericordioso para com os outros de Santa Faustina.\n\n\u00d3 Jesus, compreendo que a Vossa miseric\u00f3rdia \u00e9 inexprim\u00edvel. Por isso Vos suplico: tornai o meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e3o grande que possa conter as necessidades de todas as almas que vivem na face da terra. \u00d3 Jesus, o meu amor vai al\u00e9m do mundo, estende-se at\u00e9 \u00e0s almas que sofrem no purgat\u00f3rio; tamb\u00e9m por elas quero praticar miseric\u00f3rdia atrav\u00e9s de ora\u00e7\u00f5es que possuem indulg\u00eancias. A miseric\u00f3rdia de Deus \u00e9 sempre insond\u00e1vel e\nInesgot\u00e1vel, como \u00e9 insond\u00e1vel o pr\u00f3prio Deus. Ainda que eu me valesse das palavras mais veementes para expressar essa miseric\u00f3rdia de Deus, tudo isso nada seria em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o que ela \u00e9 na realidade. \u00d3 Jesus, fazei o meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00edvel a cada sofrimento do meu pr\u00f3ximo, seja da alma ou do corpo. \u00d3 meu\nJesus, sei que V\u00f3s procedeis conosco como n\u00f3s procedemos com o pr\u00f3ximo.\nMeu Jesus, fazei o meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o semelhante ao Vosso misericordioso Cora\u00e7\u00e3o. Jesus, ajudai-me a passar pela vida fazendo o\nBem a todos\u2026\nAm\u00e9m.\nFonte: Di\u00e1rio de Santa Faustina, II, #132\n\n3) Ora\u00e7\u00e3o do Descanso eterno:\n\nDai-lhes Senhor o descanso eterno.\nE que a luz perp\u00e9tua os ilumine. Descansem em paz.\nPai Misericordioso eu vos ofere\u00e7o o sangue precioso de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo para al\u00edvio das almas sofredoras que ainda padecem no purgat\u00f3rio. Am\u00e9m.\n\n4) Ladainha pelas almas do Purgat\u00f3rio:\n\nDeus onipotente, Pai de bondade e de miseric\u00f3rdia, tende piedade das benditas almas do purgat\u00f3rio e ajudai a meus queridos pais e antepassados.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia!

Ajudai aos pais que n\u00e3o vigiaram bem a seus filhos.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos superiores pouco atentos a salva\u00e7\u00e3o de seus s\u00faditos.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos pobres homens, que quase apenas se preocuparam do dinheiro e do prazer.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos de esp\u00edrito mundano que n\u00e3o aproveitaram suas riquezas ou talentos para o c\u00e9u.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos n\u00e9scios, que viram morrer a tantos n\u00e3o se lembrando de sua pr\u00f3pria morte.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos que n\u00e3o dispuseram a tempo de sua casa, estando completamente desprevenidos para a viagem mais importante.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos que julgais mais severamente, quanto mais lhes foi confiado.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos pont\u00edfices, reis e pr\u00edncipes.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos bispos e seus conselheiros.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai a meus mestres e pastores de almas.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos finados sacerdotes desta diocese.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos sacerdotes e religiosos da Igreja cat\u00f3lica.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos defensores da santa f\u00e9.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos ca\u00eddos nos campos de batalha.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos sepultados nos mares.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos mortos repentinamente.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Ajudai aos falecidos sem receber os Santos Sacramentos.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia! Dai-lhes, Senhor, a todas as almas o descanso eterno.\n\nJesus meu, miseric\u00f3rdia!

helped me a lot and I learned so many things, I don't think this course is for absolute beginners because it contains a lot of advanced topics but on the other hand its a great course for intermediate and advanced topics because the Flutter community lack courses like this.\nit might be a little hard to follow along with him as he make bugs, but it's a great thing to watch someone doing this because you're learning how to find bugs and fix them and this skill is very important to learn as a Programmer because you will make bugs so it's very helpful to watch a professional doing this in

Instead, I did the Academind course on Udemy (a tad outdated, but still very good). It's longer than this video, but it's broken up into multiple fun projects which makes it more bearable to get through. So for me, my learning path: First Net Ninja to break the ice. Then went through the docs top to bottom like a book. Then tinkered around for some hands-on without following any instructions. Then Udemy (Academind). Also sprinkled in some Dart videos. \n\nAnd probably most importantly during all my learning I take notes and screenshots of videos on all the things I learn as I go, organized nicely. All in MS OneNote. So when I need a refresher on any topic I actually learned (videos, docs, etc) I can find it easily in my notes. Often I'll just read the notes top to bottom to refresh/reinforce what I learned. It's almost like re-watching all the videos again, but in a very short time. :)\n\nCurrently I feel confident that I can build a small/medium app in Flutter.

It reminds me on (C++) programming books where you have to read 400 pages before you learn what a function is, and 1000 pages to hear about classes. I also don't know about what introduction video he is talking about, I can't find any links so I didn't see how the final application looks and works like. Generally, it seems as if there wasn't that much functionality implemented. I can only imagine that a lot of time was spent on implementing (time consuming) things that I, as a layman, don't understand/realise, but how many people want to know about all these specific (time consuming) things when they just want get going and develop their first basic app?\n\nI don't mean to bash, but considering that this video is 37 hours long (!), I can only assume half the time is spend (or harshly formulated, wasted) on slow talking, \"umm\"-sounds and repeating  information. If I'm not mistaken, it takes him like 90 minutes to get to the point of programming the first line of code and I don't want to know how many hours to get further stuff done. I mean, 5+ hours of this video are spent on setting various \"stuff\" up. Why does setting up Git and GitHub take 50 minutes? That sounds like something that can be explained in like 10-15 minutes. Isn't a splash screen a very simple thing? Then I wonder why it takes 50 minutes to implement it (I'm referring to the chapter timestamps). These are all aspects that make me wonder if this course is worth watching and who it was actually designed for. Definitely not for people who already have any kind of programming experience (in any language). For them the course takes way too much time and things are explained too slowly. If the video was designed for absolute beginners, then why does it take 90 minutes to program the first line of code. I feel like it shouldn't take much more than 20 minutes to get to the point of programming your first line of code, otherwise people get just bored and demotivated? For example, who cares about developer accounts in the beginning anyway? People want to get stuff done! Maybe I would have a different opinion if I actually did the course, but I feel like it would have been better if parts of this video were restructured and everything was condensed so it only took 15 hours.\n\nEither way, I hope I'm not being to harsh. Thanks for making the course (for free!) and I hope it helps many people. Unfortunately, it didn't help me (so far).
