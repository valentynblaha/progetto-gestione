We will start with a brief overview of what Sass is along with what is required to incorporate Sass into your environment. We will also set up a Sass compiler in Visual Studio Code. You will learn about Sass variables, maps, nesting, functions, mixins, extending, and operations.\n\nLastly, we will start from scratch on a real-world project (Portfolio website) using Sass. We will go step-by-step through each part, and at the end, we will deploy the site.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Project Code: https://github.com/codeSTACKr/portfolio-sass\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Tutorial from codeSTACKr.

Secondly, I use Web Compiler 2022 but if doesn't add the -moz, etc prefixes. Thirdly, the browser link is built-in and fourth, who would be allowed to use emmet in a professional environment?\n\nSCSS in VS and VS Code are different. In VS Code, you can use @use but in Visual Studio, you cannot. This is down to the developers of Visual Studio not implementing it when it's been asked for many times over the years by the Community. Also, on your map-get($weights, bold), you have to put the key in double quotes in VS. Whether that is another Microsoft issue, I have no idea. Anyway, you should be checking if the value exists in the map & display and error: @error \"bla bla bla\". Another keyword VS doesn't recognise but Dart SCSS does.\n\nIt is also recommended (in VS you can override this) to use lowercase css names for variables, colours etc. So, your variable name [lowercase][Uppercase] is fine for code behind but not variables.\nThe next item is your theme where you use lighten/darken. The recommendation is keep to a percentage of 20 or below. Sure, it takes the value of 1-100.\n\nAlthough, I am only 48 mins in, I have seen this project before in another of your videos. I know you just began but where is your SCSS structure, and have you used _config for your _variables? Don't forget the @use \"config\"; rather than @import \"config\"; Kevin Powell also agrees it seems (not watched it): https://youtu.be/CR-a8upNjJ0.\n\nNesting, I was always taught '& p {...}' and is recommended not to exceed 4 levels deep.\n\nIn brief, always great videos of yours. It seems the free VS Code is better with SCSS than the extortional VS, but I like the MSDN, so will keep buying it.\n\nBack to this video and no more comments on it.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugws610YgyPYcd0SD-B4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-23T07:42:18Z", "author": "TurkiyeBall", "text": "Sass sounds sus", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzB8MpkFo2bVmovfCd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-16T11:58:54Z", "author": "Aashish Yadav", "text": "Thanks for the amazing tutorial.

Function expressions aren't hoisted like function declarations are so you cannot call them before expressing them.\n\nAs per the usage of a ternary operator, I'm not exactly sure why you would want to in this case. You don't typically (or ever?) want to utilize ternaries for side-effects - only for expressions (something that returns a value). That being said, you could use an IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) to get done what you want but it's just more confusing IMO. \nHere is a way to do it:\n\nconst toggleMenu = () => {\n    showMenu = showMenu\n      ?
