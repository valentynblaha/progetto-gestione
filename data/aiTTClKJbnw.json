What happens when my App gets lots of Users and Firebase is too expensive? Then I want to switch my backend and with this architecture it is not possible because you use the Firebase Specific Models in the UI Code. So the UI Layer (Widgets & Screens) and the infrastructure layer (Services & Repositories) should be independent of each other and the domain layer should be independent from Flutter and Firebase. Then the domain layer defines contracts and models which are implemented in the infrastructure layer and the UI layer is then using these implementations via dependency injection.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Tadas Petra", "text": "Yea you are right.
