You might not need math but if you ever decide to go into graphics programming, you'll be glad you learned math. Also, get a proper book on your language of choice and study it to the nth degree. Then actually put to practice what you've been reading, instead of copying code that you really don't know the inner workings of.\n\n The main problem for many is learning the actual syntax of the language but then they get stuck when actually trying to design something. This only tells me that they spent too long learning the grammar but they aren't trying to construct proper sentences and in this case, the sentences are the software.\n\nIt doesn't have to be just books. It can be any resource, as long as you aren't mindlessly copying and not really understanding what you're typing. The reason you see programmers seemingly coming up with solutions to problems and just typing out lots of code with you going: \"How the hell can they do that?\" It's because that's their actual code they're typing. Not someone else's. There's thousands of ways to make the same thing in programming and it's only when you start to find a balance between referencing code and actually typing and tinkering with your own, you'll find that things just come to you a lot quicker than before.\n\nGreat software developers don't memorize, they operate and construct solutions to the problem by trying to solve it themselves.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bechar Gherbi", "text": "The same talk I hear everytime.
