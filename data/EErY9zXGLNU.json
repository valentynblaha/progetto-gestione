I will present some helpful tips about self-motivation, time-management, stop procrastination, setting priorities, staying organized, believing in yourself and keeping a balance between your career and personal life. I'm going to present my personal examples of coding/studying every single day for the past 1,5 years, what I gained and how I achieved my goals. We are going to explore ways of finding mentors, friends and expanding your social network. This talk is not only about getting better at your 9 to 5 job but also about developing yourself.\n\nTalk by Eleftheria Batsou at Codegarden.\n\n\ud83d\udc26Eleftheria on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BatsouElef\n\ud83d\udcf9 See more from Eleftheria on her channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/EleftheriaBatsou\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT13M13S", "likes": "5202", "views": "175081"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyVteDuAgm_mtoXOIx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-12T00:48:06Z", "author": "Monkey Robots Inc.", "text": "dont care. oh wait, that azz. nice.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxdvVDqmO6K3QroR-B4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-11T07:53:32Z", "author": "Rudra pratap Singh", "text": "yes i accept this #100 days of code", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgztExuKDCCCytgkDpJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-30T02:06:24Z", "author": "Indian MTB Rider", "text": "Today is my last day of the journey. 100 th day.
