Good job there!\n\nI know it's may seem minor, but this char \";\" is a semi-colon not a colon which looks like \":\". Your continually saying \"colon\" when you mean \"semi-colon\" really threw me off at first.\n\nThis is not so minor. You tell us \"just use a text editor\", but then you don't do that, don't tell us what tool you are using, and you let the tool do a lot of things auto-magically. That means it's really really hard to reproduce what you're doing -- and during the first lesson. To make it worse, you're assuming a specific directory structure but spend only about 2 seconds showing us what that is, and don't show us the commands we should use to run it if we were using only a terminal and text editor like you suggested.

(speed) in this case is an integer variable. It's best to define the variable before using it in a method. For exampe, int speed = 10;       We define the variable before using it so that we can use it in more than just one method. For example, I can use the drive(speed) method, and I know that when I do so then whenever I call that method, the speed will ALWAYS be 10 because I've already defined it. On the other hand, I can create a NEW method called \"walk\". If I made a method like this:  walk(speed), I know that my walk speed will ALWAYS be 10 as well! Also, you cannot set a method's parameters using variables that you've defined within the method that you created them in. For example, if I wrote drive(speed) { int speed = 10; }, my drive method would not know that it has to look within itself to understand what the speed variable is. If I wrote it that way, the function of the drive method would simply be to MAKE the variable that I can use in another instance. So let's say I create the \"drive\" method without setting the parameter to speed, but I still create the speed variable within the method. drive() { int speed = 10; },  Then I made ANOTHER method and then I called the drive method within the second method, I suppose you could do it that way. That would be much more complicated in this usage of variables than setting the variable prior to creating any methods at all! If you're confused, just think of it like setting the physics of a world. You have to know the mechanics of friction before you create a functioning wheel!
