Also, it now appears to be out of date, so I would not waste any more time on it just in case there are other issues further down the line. I have given up on next, I much prefer Gatsby. And the reason for this is that as a beginner you are going to make mistakes. However in next, when you make an error, the errors messages are so terse and vague that its difficult to figure whats wrong and how to fix it. With gatsby, this is much less the case in my limited experience. First impressions count, and my initail impression of Gatsby is much better than next, but hey thats just me. Please don''t get me wrong, I always appreciate good tutorials and the effort that people put in to creating free content, but publishers of content should not be misleading or do a bait and switch, which feel this is.

Install 'next-sanity-image' as a dependency.\n2. in the next.config.js file, you need to add \"images: { domains: ['cdn.sanity.io'] }\" (Assuming you opted for the cdn, I assume it would just be localhost:3333 instead if you didn't, but I'm not sure).\n3. Create a file called something like SanityImage.js in a components folder and import Image from 'next/image', the 'useNextSanityImage' hook from 'next-sanity-image', and the sanity client because the hook needs that.\n4. This SanityImage component is just going to be a wrapper around the next Image component because each image needs to use that hook (but you don't know how many images there will be necessarilly) so it can't be done in the index.js (and this is a generally reusable component anyway), so just have it take in { src, alt } as props where the source is just recipe.mainImage and alt can be recipe.name.\n5. the first line of the component should setup the sanity image hook 'const imageProps = useNextSanityImage(sanityClient, src);' and the second should just return <Image src={imageProps} alt={alt} /> (You can also add any other styles to the image in here that should be applied to all images across the site. You could also spread any other props you'd like to make it more dynamic.)\n6. Then you just import that component and use it instead of img wherever you would do that.\n\nnote: You can still target .recipe-card img just the same because there is ultimately an img within that li inside of the Image component that Next provides, though you will need to use !important on most of the styles because apparently next adds inline styles for some reason? You may also need to add \"imageProps && <Image src={imageProps} alt={alt} />\" once the usePreview subscription happens because it seems to send an undefined value in at first render and then once the response comes in, it rerenders with the image.", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxrMorBog5IVgvfAhR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-17T17:48:09Z", "author": "Ken's channel", "text": "so beautiful", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx9nrxp8Fy0pxVvPj54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-12T15:45:35Z", "author": "Muhammad Bilal", "text": "You use Sanity most in the video rather than Next.js , Kindly imporve your learning material focus on the main thing that you are going to provide , anyway GOOD STUFF KEEP IT UP", "likes": 14}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzghAelP1XAoz7myzZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-30T01:50:20Z", "author": "Tydev 719", "text": "I love these full courses from FCC but...this is like 20% Next.js and 80% just an ad for Sanity.io....\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "likes": 16}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxAhGTisgbmE-7aqmF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-28T21:02:34Z", "author": "\u00d6MER KARATA\u015e", "text": "Thank you for your time to prepare this tutorial, but most of the video is about Sanity not about NextJS features.
