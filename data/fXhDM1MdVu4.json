Keila is a 15-year-old programmer, web designer, and technologist.\n\nFor any system to survive it must figure out how to bring in new members. In this keynote, you'll hear from Keila Banks who since 11 years old (now 15) has been speaking at conferences around the world; and her father Phillip Banks, who's been programming since he was 10 and provided the same path for his children. Along with 3 other sons, they have all been a part of technology efforts and open source communities since their youth. Hear from a teen how you can help grow open source communities and youth involvement from what we've learned along the way.\n\nTalk originally given at the Open Source Leadership Summit 2018.\n\nThis talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
