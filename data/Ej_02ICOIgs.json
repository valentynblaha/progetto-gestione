Function annotations are nothing more than a way of associating arbitrary Python expressions with various parts of a function at compile-time. By itself, Python does not attach any particular meaning or significance to annotations.\n\nThe only way that annotations take on meaning is when they are interpreted by third-party libraries. These annotation consumers can do anything they want with a function\u2019s annotations. For example, one library might use string-based annotations to provide improved help messages, like so:\n\n```Python\ndef compile(source: \"something compilable\",\n            filename: \"where the compilable thing comes from\",\n            mode: \"is this a single statement or a suite?\"):\n    ...\n```\n\nAnother library might be used to provide typechecking for Python functions and methods. This library could use annotations to indicate the function\u2019s expected input and return types, possibly something like:\n\n```Python\ndef haul(item: Haulable, *vargs: PackAnimal) -> Distance:\n    ...\n```\n\nHowever, neither the strings in the first example nor the type information in the second example have any meaning on their own; meaning comes from third-party libraries alone.\n```", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwyxOhR5q7YTNHbOj54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-11-09T18:38:01Z", "author": "Usama Niaz", "text": "Thanks alot, I have learned alot.

In the run validations to arguments part, if you aren't getting an error when you use an integer as the name, type in assert type(name) == str. This will not accept anything other than an integer as the name.\n\n2. Make sure you have no spaces between the list in the items.CSV file. Its a minor thing but gave me a headache since I couldn't get past that for a while. Then do the normal int(item.get()) then it works fine.\n\nFinally most of the issues I encountered were as a result of not looking at the code long enough. If you encounter a problem, make sure to re watch the part where he DOS it and make sure you got it correct. This happened to me at the Len part and a few others. \n\nFinally if you encounter s problem not stated here, then copy the error and paste it in your browser. This shows a stackoverflow page first where you can figure out what's wrong. \n\nHope this helps you and you don't have to go through the headache I did when solving those lol", "likes": 61}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugwg6dXP8ubig9YXrEd4AaABAg.9WzOfw74bGo9il-nAO_qHs", "publishedAt": "2022-11-23T03:52:21Z", "author": "Sonam Sherpa", "text": "I owe you so much man that space thing was eating my brain too", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugwg6dXP8ubig9YXrEd4AaABAg.9WzOfw74bGo9gW8cJ5dHCO", "publishedAt": "2022-09-28T06:58:52Z", "author": "Zaeem Akhtar", "text": "good", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugwg6dXP8ubig9YXrEd4AaABAg.9WzOfw74bGo9fpSBVdipB-", "publishedAt": "2022-09-11T07:43:15Z", "author": "NazifaSalman", "text": "Hero", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugwg6dXP8ubig9YXrEd4AaABAg.9WzOfw74bGo9fnOMMCJqiU", "publishedAt": "2022-09-10T12:31:18Z", "author": "notryosukesan", "text": "you fucking legend !!", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugwg6dXP8ubig9YXrEd4AaABAg.9WzOfw74bGo9dbsn2RhixU", "publishedAt": "2022-07-18T08:12:17Z", "author": "Steven Fenix", "text": "legend here, tnx!!!!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxZFjYQLTngBuNlZ7p4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-09T04:01:19Z", "author": "Swapnil Chauhan", "text": "Thanks this is a amazing tutorial !", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyhUqvWi_n-vfcTB694AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-08T06:16:47Z", "author": "Shreyas KUlkarni", "text": "WOW!!!
