Function annotations are nothing more than a way of associating arbitrary Python expressions with various parts of a function at compile-time. By itself, Python does not attach any particular meaning or significance to annotations.\n\nThe only way that annotations take on meaning is when they are interpreted by third-party libraries. These annotation consumers can do anything they want with a function\u2019s annotations. For example, one library might use string-based annotations to provide improved help messages, like so:\n\n```Python\ndef compile(source: \"something compilable\",\n            filename: \"where the compilable thing comes from\",\n            mode: \"is this a single statement or a suite?\"):\n    ...\n```\n\nAnother library might be used to provide typechecking for Python functions and methods. This library could use annotations to indicate the function\u2019s expected input and return types, possibly something like:\n\n```Python\ndef haul(item: Haulable, *vargs: PackAnimal) -> Distance:\n    ...\n```\n\nHowever, neither the strings in the first example nor the type information in the second example have any meaning on their own; meaning comes from third-party libraries alone.\n```", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Usama Niaz", "text": "Thanks alot, I have learned alot.
