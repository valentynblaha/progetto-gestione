Often using git just for basic commit and pushes. I do branches, too, and I am now have a chance to getting know about CI. After watching the video above, what I understand is (if I am going to implement this with my team) from Alex doing from live demo there, the system will do syntax and file path checking (or something else I did not know). Lets say my and my whole team always writing our code syntax correctly, or target files are exist, would it means the build will always passing?
