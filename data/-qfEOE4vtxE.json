For the life of me, I can't figure out how to do this in BS.\n\nI tried playing with the navbars, but really don't like the rigid and very limited aesthetics. \nI prefer the ability to use links because they offer much greater flexibility, but in BS, I can't figure out how to apply a style that keeps that god awful blue link from showing up during hover.", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"author": "Gareth Nel", "text": "should try tailwind css", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mohammad Faisal", "text": "You don't explain very well.
