One question: At 50:55 you say that containers are/can be used for operating systems!  And yet, a short while later at 52:20, you explain why containers are NOT used/best choice to host operating systems.  I believe that your earlier statement is erroneous.  Now a silly question: In cases such as web browsers and applications like Skype, the end users are still installing these apps on their devices; aren't they?  At least I know I have physically installed all three of my web browsers and Skype on my everyday laptop.  So I don't understand your comment about how everyone is moving away from installing applications and running them from containers instead!  Am I wrong in interpreting that it's the application developers/providers who host them in containers, and there's no change on the end user side in how they consume the service?  Am I way behind the curve here?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwW6iLAFeucpXfvJ-Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-08T00:28:12Z", "author": "matix26", "text": "This is the best tutorial on docker so far.

I scrolled through your entire library looking for an upload about AppArmor, FireJail, and IPTables.\n\n  Back story in a nutshell: After installing Arch for the first time, I learned linux security the hard way. Within 48 hours, I lost control of PAM to port 22. It's no big deal. I overwrote the drive.\n   After that, I came across several lectures by Aaron Jones posted on a small YT channel with the name Brian Cluff, (I have no affiliation with either party). He does some interesting presentations on Linux security. Like the Arch Linux Wiki, Aaron's presentations are more abstract guides as opposed to stepped tutorials.\n   Aaron is a big proponent of Docker, thus the reason I searched and watched this upload. He does a good job of explaining security. I've fumbled my way through installing AppArmor, FireJail, raw IPTables and then UFW. Aaron also recommended the IceCat web browser, and notes his distrust of JavaScript. \n  His day job is for the Arizona Police Department, has a masters in (?something related to?) Computer Science, and (IIRC) received his credentials while serving in the US military. He's someone to be aware of if you're looking for potential content to showcase. His stuff on YT is done on his own time for a local linux users group.\n  Anyways, in my quest to learn embedded hardware, I'm to the point where I want to learn more about networking and security. I'm often searching obscure references, looking in foreign language forums, and downloading from dubious sources trying to learn about some chip I've come across or want to use. Assuming one day I will be working for someone that is on the other side of proprietary IP, I would like to have a better understanding of how to sandbox and segment applications access, especially with the risk of JavaScript and bots on the web. I have not been successful finding effective tutorial content on AppArmor, FireJail, and a comprehensive Firewall addressing all ports while still allowing a fully dev-capable machine. I want to be able to address things like proprietary code and it's network access. I want to know how to monitor and filter all access within and outside of my machine. \n  Also I'm interested in a guide on effective management of logging in conjunction with SSD's. We all (should) have SSD's  now, and unmanaged logging is one of the quickest paths to buying a new one. A comprehensive guide to securing a development workstation that fails to address logging and SSD's is incomplete IMO.\n  This is just a piece of the dev's pie I think you're missing in the current camp library. I hope you find something good to fill the void.\n Thanks for all you do here.\n-Jake", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyiyL2ZVrFsCoceE2F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-06-02T07:58:32Z", "author": "Anoop Singh", "text": "Very informative , Perfect for a beginner And practice lab makes it even better.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy6ORgGLLHBYiCW4bB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-31T01:18:12Z", "author": "sanketh s", "text": "Hi All,\n\nversion: \"2\"\r\nservices:\r\n\r\n  db:\r\n    image: postgres\r\n    environment:\r\n     POSTGRES_PASSWORD: \"mysecretpassword\"\r\n  wordpress:\r\n    depends_on:\r\n     - db\r\n    image: wordpress\r\n    ports:\r\n     - \"8085:80\"\r\n \n\nNot sure why DB is not getting linked with wordpress.\n\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxnYCFvRqIVMyYayXh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-30T04:32:06Z", "author": "steveoz", "text": "Havnt watched yet - but 2 thumbs up anyway for no ads.  \nAds are ruining youtube - let alone tutes.\nGimme a patreon link so I can show my appreciation :)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxmyCLM-gfYDoagtH14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-29T19:57:21Z", "author": "Abhishek Pathak", "text": "I can't be enough grateful for explaining docker to me and that too so easily.

A great example is when you explain why docker-compose.yml files NEED to have the version number at the top, or why they DON'T need links in the same way.\n\nYou have incredible animations and good presentation skills, and everything is crystal-clear. I am so, so impressed and grateful. I am not a programmer or developer. I might be described as a power-user, but I very rarely write any code at all. I have found this tutorial to be very easy to follow even for someone with super limited knowledge of the programming world. For example, I know next to nothing about most of the systems we are running in the voting app stack. I have never used any of them or written anything in any of them. Even so, you made it easy for me to follow along and focus on DOCKER, not those other things.\n\nThis is the gold standard and I hope you and anyone else who worked on it are proud of this series.

Does this have to do with docker run being in attached mode by default? or if I run the container using docker start its in detached mode? \n\n\n2. How do I know what map network to map to that specific container? \n\n\nlike for mongo I did this \n\n\n`docker run -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongo-container -v mongoVol:/app mongo:latest`\n\n\n3. the same goes for volume mapping, how do I know the path I'm mapping to?
