I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called \u201cFischer Random Chess,\u201d where the starting position of the pieces is \u201crandomized\u201d to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0\r\n\r\nBIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyzIQBdeYMB2LVmq2x4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-29T00:40:33Z", "author": "Nader Ahmed", "text": "Wait, What is israel ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz-Ecj-3eZQs3l__994AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-12T16:50:56Z", "author": "moofymoo", "text": "idk, take this video with grain of salt, it have good points, but also lot of personal preference.\nI'm sick of pointless meetings about indentantion and then doing long crunch time, because half of project time was wasted in 'architecting' endless abstraction layers because SOLID good, man wrote principle in book.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz1NxMUpin8wMLYXTd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-12T16:34:59Z", "author": "moofymoo", "text": "press \"windows key\" and \"r\" key at same time\ntype \"cmd\" and press enter\nclick on that weird black rectangle that shows up\ntype \"color 2\" and press \"enter\"\ntype \"tree\" and press \"enter\"\n\nlooks like pro enough..", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzmr-ZTlhf71fEbS6h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-28T19:17:48Z", "author": "zoso", "text": "Isn't the factorial function incorrect?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwsfHsyXNMj70ydpDR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-16T17:55:06Z", "author": "Smarty Bantu", "text": "Elon Musk somewhere in parallel world", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzfvbMT40S87w1oVCV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-04T22:21:47Z", "author": "iVuDang", "text": "Great video.

I agree when you talk about small objects and classes; inheritance and being aware of consequences in your programming/development tree --> whether it's the coffee-table or a formal meeting -- this will always remain a discussion - you summarize the internet debate in a clear and sympathetic way.\r\n\n\nBut the second hour: hop skip and jump without explanation. Elaborate examples where here just the details count. (I know backticks but I am not so sure you are using them in the right way - that is a step back to assembly programming and who wants to do that these days??).\r\nWaiting for another video and hoping that you take a step back.\r\n\n\nBenny\r\n\n\nP.S. 1,// You recommend not to but I do use comments in my code: e.g.:\r\n- it makes a difference whether I study through Mozilla or Google - I like to refer and explain my choise. it's all ES?? newest but approaches are different and I like to follow the debates.\r\n- I always refer to web-sites where I get my info; e.g. Processing (p5.js) is an example. That takes \\\\ here and there but does not influence the code.\r\n- Readers / programmers can skip tricks that I use while programming but are a complete independent unit. E.g. I have growing trees in a natural environment; studied and programmed through courses at processing.com; Not an animated GIF but pure JavaScript. This requires (1) reference / thanks to the teacher I started with   (2) explanation to  the way I implement a \"stolen\" function and still try to be honest.\r\nP.S. 2, Hope I am not too harsh - rereading the above - you gave me a good course and a little debate.

It means the function can be called without instantiating the class, only the reference to the class is needed. Essentially, you end up having a class with only one function that is static.

I was hired before I finished all of my training (bootcamp, Freecodecamp, etc.) so I've been anxious about the quality of my code. I'm glad to see that my practices are not too far off what have been suggested here. \n\nOverall, I really liked this video and I'm leaving it with new ideas and feeling relieved for the most part about my code quality.\n\nThe only thing I can say though is that I would have loved to see what the best practices are for dealing with chained Promises, embedded callbacks, proper use of async/await and lastly for using middleware functions. Chained promises or embedded callbacks can make extremely ugly code even if it doesn't necessarily mean that the code is unstable. Async/await isn't always the solution: some of my colleagues who have used it saw their functions resolving too early or doing something unexpected and generally had less of an idea how their code worked than when they use Promises. I haven't had time to experiment with async/await so I'm still on Promises unless it's more appropriate to use callbacks. Lastly, the (infamous) next() function... it's great when you can figure out what is actually being called and what the function stack is but sometimes when a person doesn't know the code they're reading, it can be completely obscure what is going on. This is particularly a problem, I find, in Express.js and not so much in front-end frameworks that might employ 'middleware' like Vue-Router.", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzVVZ4mfSXV-AHpboN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-03-09T01:55:41Z", "author": "glanceD", "text": "Type fast and wear a nice shade.\n\n\n\n\n\n..
