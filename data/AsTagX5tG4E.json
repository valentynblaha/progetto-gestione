You were correct in the first few minutes of your video.

That is one of the most important parts about learning in this overwhelming field.

Don't worry about having fancy mic and camera.\n2. Choose a topic that you are passionate about. \n3. BE CONSISTENT and upload weekly/monthly. If you're traveling, record the videos in advance.\n4. Goals for consistency should be measurable, timed and controllable. For example, Put out one video (measurable) per week (timed)\n5. Outsource designing of logos and graphics to Fiverr (freelance). Later stages, outsource the video editing if it's affordable.\n6. Set the positive tone. Don't reply to negative comments and block offensive comments\n7. Don't copy other videos. Be original\n8. Video planning - Brainstorm, pair down ideas, research, write script\n9. For coding, record the video separately from audio. Overlap audio over video. Also, editor font size should be big.\n10. Free video editing - OpenShot, Videopad, Lightworks\n11. Create attractive thumbnails and titles. Be creative \n12. Image editing - PS, Gimp(free), Affinity photo(1-time cost)\n13. What people are searching for? Find out on YouTube autocomplete and Google Trends \n14. What the Algorithm DOES NOT care about? *\n\t1. Upload frequency - not correlated with views you get but possibility of getting subscribers\n\t2. Video Tags - count as nothing. Lowest impact. Used as identifier until YT finds pattern\n\t3. How well a previous video performed \n\t4. Descriptions - Put the most important keywords towards the beginning of your description. Don't put ads or links in the 1st line\n\t5. Subscriber count  - Subscriber will see the video higher in the search results \n\t6. Average percentage of video viewed\n15. What algorithm cares about? \n\t1. Click through rate - The percentage of people who clicked your video after seeing its thumbnail\n\t2. Average View Duration - Should be atleast average 7 minutes watch time \n16. Making money\n\t1. Help you get a job or raise - While making videos you eventually develop skills \n\t2. YouTube Ads \n\t\t1. 1$-2.50$ per 1000 views, \n\t\t2. If they select \"Skip Ads\", you make no money. \n\t3. Promote your paid courses. Create two full length courses. Put one on YT and other on your paid website\n\t4. Patreon page - If you are interested inn building a community and adding value \n\t\t1. Add value content for free before starting Patreon\n\t\t2. Build a following outside youtube. \n\t\t3. Study successful Patreon pages \n\t\t4. Before launch, draft your Patreon page and get honest feedback from top fans\n\t\t5. Talk to your fans about joining your Patreon page. Don't push them \n\t\t6. Once people join, give value. Example, Interact with your fans \n\t\t7. Bonus content, cool rewards, personal tutorials, etc \n\t5. Video Sponsorships \n\t\t1. Have a contact form on your website and collect information about the interests of your customer (companies who wanna advertise on your channel).\n\t\t2. Share this form with your audience\n\t\t3. Make your value proposition clear.  Example, web dev or app dev\n\t\t4. Quantify the value - track the click through rate  and performance \n\t\t5. Grow your sponsorship base - try to make your ads creative. Grow from free sponsorship  to highly paid sponsorship\n\n17. Promoting \n\t1. can be challenging if you are just starting out \n\t2. Post to relevant subreddits \n\t3. Submit to coding newsletters like the CodeNewBie newsletter \n\t4. Post on programming forums\n18. Miscellaneous \n\t1. Add end screens \n\t2. Link to playlists in description \n\t3. Post long videos. For short videos, do not upload all of them at once \n\t4. Expect each video is the first video someone sees. If they need basic info to watch the current video, link the prerequisite videos in the description \n\t5. Never use background music in coding tutorial \n\t6. If you're including the series name in the title, it should be at the end of the title.", "likes": 22}, "replies": [{"author": "Marwan", "text": "Thank you!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "egg sand", "text": "Next idea: Teach people how to create a Youtube channel for teaching people how to create a coding Youtube channel\n\nNext.next idea: Teach people how to create a Youtube channel teaching people how to create a channel for teaching people how to create a coding Youtube channel", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "The Coding Turkey", "text": "Hey, I am a 14-year-old starting my own coding channel.

I mean, I click it for NONE of my subs because I come to YouTube when I feel like it and don't want any notifications about anything. 2nd, the home page most often has videos from my subs anyway. And even further, all I have to do is click on the \"Subscriptions\" area and I'll see the whole list of videos from my subs in relatively chronological order. So that said, what benefit is it for ME to click the bell icon? Every person who tells me to click on it in their videos, is usually \"for the YouTube algorithm\", which is incredibly annoying. Humans shouldn't have to change their behavior to fit algorithms, but rather the algorithms should change to adopt to human behaviors. So now we have YouTubers basically asking and pleading viewers to do things just for the algos, which is backwards.\n\n\nEven further, if I subscribe to 100 channels, and I certainly want them all to succeed, I'm not going to click the bell icon for all 100 of them just to help out the algos. I don't need a huge pile of notifications every 20 minutes!\n\n\nSame with the like/dislike buttons. I know if I click Like, YouTube keeps those in a list, but in 10+ years of YouTube, I've only ever visited my \"liked list\" maybe twice just for kicks. It's a useless feature in my opinion, it doesn't change whether I watch or not watch a video, I don't glance at likes first to see if other people like it, etc. So once again, we have a feature built not because humans really use it, but because the algos need it, and so YouTubers have to beg us to click it \"for the algos\". It's just dumb, and doesn't really fit natural human behavior. YouTube doesn't tell me how it benefits ME to click like or dislike. I'm sure it means something in some way, but I don't know, I never click them, because it isn't for my benefit or the creator's really, it's \"for the algos\".
