Here are some tips that were missing from the tutorial. Run the program *very* often and do *very* small changes to make sure your code keeps working. It is a good practice to avoid \"magic values\" in your code. If you use (0, 0, 0) to represent black, write black = (0, 0, 0). If your play area width on screen is game board width times block size in pixels, write play_area_width_px = game_board_width * block_size_px. Also, in this tutorial we are inventing new rules for Tetris as we go. Since we are trying reimplementing an existing game we'd be better off following some existing specification. For example, we might decide to implement the \"Standard Rotation System\" that specifies one specific way of rotating the blocks.", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxrkWDfoKC4y2xpq1R4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-16T13:35:24Z", "author": "david askren", "text": "I fix the errors I had and the game dosnt come up", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzaVo7tXJ2tp6LuxaB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-27T10:04:12Z", "author": "Kelvin- Air", "text": "I don not understand by the word top_left_x and top_left_y.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz2R3EtI3IG6VHP81V4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-12T14:53:48Z", "author": "Lise Recette", "text": "Did you write all this code yourself?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy9V9bjVIWQGU6tG9R4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-11T11:22:10Z", "author": "Alvin Zhu", "text": "hello? if anyone is reading this then please help.
