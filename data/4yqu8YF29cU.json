Along with MySQL and PostgreSQL, Mongo DB an industry-standard database consideration among startups and large companies alike. But unlike the other two, Mongo DB is the de-facto standard for document based databases and has exploded in popularity since its release in 2009. \n\n\ud83d\udcbbFiles: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/7lxecwj9n7heq/MongoDB_Tutorial\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://www.turbo360.co/\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (00:00) 1.
