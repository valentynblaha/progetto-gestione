So if you just build the react app and run the container, you'd most likely get a CRASHLOOPBACKOFF error (if you're running it in K8s for example) which would mean the container inside the pod keeps crashing. \nAn nginx container can be understood as a server that's always running, which means there's always a running process, so that keeps the pod/container alive. \nSo you put the react app inside the nginx container because the react app can't 'stay alive' on it's own and needs something else to keep it alive, which is usally an nginx container. \nSomeone can correct me if I'm wrong about anything, as I'm also learning these technologies \ud83d\ude42\n\nThis medium blog post exactly answers your question: https://tiangolo.medium.com/react-in-docker-with-nginx-built-with-multi-stage-docker-builds-including-testing-8cc49d6ec305", "likes": 4}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Trust Onyemachi", "text": "You guys are the best so much love for you guys", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "vaish ambre", "text": "exactly what i needed..thanks guyz", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "FranklinAndOprahBFF", "text": "i think you just helped me get a job <3", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Premdas V.m", "text": "Regarding NestJs, what if i had folder outside my Src folder which contains images uploaded to my application, how ill i add that to the docker container?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "BILLY THE KID", "text": "Thank you very much. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Yilmaz Durmaz", "text": "seeing all the little differences of different apps being containerized. that made my day.\nthanks for the great content", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Thomas Ryan", "text": "I'm failing to find the source code/materials to go along with this video.
