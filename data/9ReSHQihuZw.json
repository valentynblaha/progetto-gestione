Also, a good teacher would explain multiple solutions where they exist.\n\nOn 26->27, while reading the manual of \"more\", he conveniently skips the \"!\" key, which is designed to execute the commands. Of course it doesn't work, but a proper teacher would demonstrate this non-solution too, and explain why it doesn't work. Here the explanation is that \"more\" uses $SHELL to run the commands (via the \"-c\" option), and bandit26's weird shell does not provide this possibility, and there is no possibility to override it. Therefore we need to search for alternatives, and in this case, the alternative is to escape to vim and try running commands there. Again, a proper teacher who demonstrates the thought process, as opposed to just the attempt to reproduce the memorized solution, would first show the obvious way to execute commands or shell from vim - e.g. by googling \"vim execute command\" (again, pointing to \"!\", which doesn't work), \"vim override shell\" (leads to stackoverflow with \":set shell\"). This is also a good opportunity to showcase the built-in vim help, e.g. by running \":help shell\" (which also mentions the \"shell\" option that can be set).\n\nOn 32-> 33, the jump from the inability to use lower-case letters to positional arguments is also not explained at all. Here is how I did it. My first idea was to find a useful command that uses only upper-case characters, in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. \"ls /usr/bin/[A-Z]* /usr/sbin/[A-Z]*\" however yields nothing useful, and so another idea would be to use special characters or digits, these are not mangled. Metacharacters like \"*\" only allow us to run another copy of the uppercase shell, which is not useful. Octal escapes, like $'\\167'? Sorry, no - these work in bash only, not in sh. Try to run $SHELL? No, this again refers to the uppercase shell. Try to make \"sh\" out of the existing variables, as guessed by observing what other bandits see? Tried, doesn't work:\n\nA=${SHELL%???}\nB=${A##*/?????}\n$B  # Nope (actually shell variables do not persist between lines, but I wouldn't hope that the participant will discover this)\n\nA=${SHELL%???} ; B=${A##*/?????} ; $B  # Works (and is a different solution than presented) - but, as I said, not really guessable\n\nTry to import \"/bin/sh\" as a value of one of the environment variables permitted by ssh?\n\nOTW_HACK=/bin/sh ssh -o SendEnv=OTW_HACK -p 2220 bandit32@bandit.labs.overthewire.org\n$OTW_HACK\n\n...yay, works (and is a different solution than presented). Amusingly, when /bin/bash is smuggled this way, this gets us to the home of bandit33, not bandit32, because of the special setuid handling in bash.\n\nAnd then explain $0. Explain, instead of just demonstrating, that, in a shell that doesn't run a script, it is documented to expand to the shell name.", "likes": 6}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxw5cTrTtsMKqsi9-p4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-11-18T16:43:46Z", "author": "ABHI \ud83d\udd25", "text": "Thank you so much \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f for this video, it's really helpful.
