This course will introduce you to Postman and is suited for beginners. You will learn how to build API requests with Postman, how to inspect responses and create workflows.\n\nThe second part of the course will get into the most exciting feature of Postman: writing API tests and automating their execution. You will learn about the collection runner, Postman monitors and Newman.\n\nYou will get hands-on experience and will have plenty opportunities to practice. The best way to learn is by doing the assignments. \n\n\ud83d\udcda Course Notes: https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created by Valentin Despa, Developer Educator\n\ud83d\udc26 Valentin on Twitter: @vdespa\n\ud83d\udcfa Valentin on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUUl_HXJjU--iYjUkIgEcTw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Unit 1 - Introduction to Postman\n\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 1 - Welcome (0:00:00\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 2 - What is Postman (0:01:12\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 3 - How to install Postman (0:03:06\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 4 - Your first request with Postman (0:04:45\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 5 - HTTP (0:07:07\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 6 - Postman collections and variables (0:11:10\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 7 - Query parameters (0:15:55\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 8 - Assignment (0:22:50\u200b)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 9 - Path variables (0:25:21)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 10 - POST request / API Authentication (0:30:07)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 11 - JSON format (0:41:21)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 12 - Assignment (0:45:11)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 13 - Random test data (0:47:32)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 14 - Is Postman the right tool for me?

You cannot request open interface services from ###.###.###.###.\" Each time I run it within Monitors, it returns a different IP address. \nJust some additional information .. the site I am accessing requires whitelisting of IP Addresses.

Thank you very much for this introduction to Postman! It was a lot of new stuff to learn, but I'm sure it will be worth it.

There is one question that came up towards the end of this course. When running the monitor manually in the video, it fails because the initial value of the accessToken was not present. You then copied the value from CURRENT VALUE to INITIAL VALUE and the monitor then ran without error. Is it safe, to set the accessToken to the INITIAL VALUE for the monitor? Won't it be exposed to the public in that case? Again, thanks, and have a good time.
