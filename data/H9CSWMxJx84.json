Adding the lasers audio is fine but the problem is with next step - adding the explode audio, Safari and Firefox now return an error in console and no sound is played. The warning is: \"Autoplay is only allowed when approved by the user, the site is activated by the user, or media is muted.\" and then followed by this error: \"Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play method is not allowed by the user agent or the platform in the current context, possibly because the user denied permission.\" These errors only appear if the ship explodes before you fire your lasers. If you fire a laser then there is no error and sound plays. Also if you manage to progress to the next step of development and add music files then you get the error straight away as soon as the page loads. Presumably the error is a security feature that means sound doesn't auto play by default until the user properly interacts with it first. Unless there is a work around then you cannot complete this tutorial to the end. Currently Chrome doesn't throw an error and haven't tested MS Edge. The source files also throw these errors. Also I swapped around the keys used and the spacebar key is deemed as a legitimate interaction but the arrow keys are not.

You can THINK you typed everything letter for letter, but in reality, you put too many closing brackets or spelled a variable wrong. This is why it is important to use debugging. Like Ajdin Masic mentioned, open up the console in google chrome or what ever browser you're using. It'll tell you if there are any errors. If nothing pops up, then that means everything is working fine, but the game logic is flawed on your part. This part is a little more complicated, but use console.log() to output certain things relating to the problem. If your shim isn't slowing down, use console.log() to ouput the friction amount, the speed amount before and after friction is applied, and also if friction is being applied. From there, you can view the data and see exactly what is happening in the code. This is essential for every developer, as nothing always goes exactly as you planned.
