Less than 10% of people applying for programming jobs have a GitHub profile. Even less have their own website. Having one or both of those will very likely get your resume pushed up to the top of the pile. Honestly, it doesn't even need to be impressive. Just the fact that you have taken time outside of work to post a couple incomplete personal learning projects says a lot about your ambition.
