You never explained in the video how to utilize the live SASS compiler add-on and as such my about section refused to format correctly because the code in my styles.scss was never being complied down my styles.css file.\n\nFor those of you that are having formatting issues with regards to this project, may I humbly submit that you may be having issues because you have not hit ctrl+shift+p to open the command palette and typed \"live SASS: Watch SASS\". This will make sure that when you save your styles.scss is being complied down to the styles.css file without you manually having to compile after each change. This was an extremely frustrating problem to deal with and I wish it could have been addressed in the video.\n\nI have still managed to learn a lot of what is possible in html from the video and it is an excellent resource for reference code as many parts of the code can be used in other situations. However, this was not a very good tutorial because it did not go over the underlying thought process of 'why' things were ultimately structured the way they were. I understand this is largely because of just how much material is being covered but I would appreciate a change in the video's title to say \"Coding Demo\" rather than \"Tutorial\" as that is a better reflection of the video's content.
