I really brushed up a lot of concepts. But one thing that I am noticing can you please clarify that in Tree Min Value example the Tree that you chose is not properly balanced and thus it looses the beauty of Binary Tree. See the root is 5 so on the right there should be a bigger value and on the left it should be smaller value. That will definitely reduce the effort of the algorithm to search the minimum value as half of the tree the complete right side will be avoided while being searched. And similarly all up coming nodes will do the same for each node that divides the child nodes in two portions. So searching for the Minimum will be pretty easy in this case as you have to just keep on searching the left side till the depth. Can be done recursive or iterative. Please see if I am missing something and you can elaborate well.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugypyh2XQDfBZhQOuC14AaABAg.9cAWAnDgTig9d9MrJz8oAB", "publishedAt": "2022-07-06T21:06:32Z", "author": "Just Ave0n ~ Recruiter", "text": "@xbread31 what he said x2", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugypyh2XQDfBZhQOuC14AaABAg.9cAWAnDgTig9cGs96UbrpY", "publishedAt": "2022-06-14T22:32:01Z", "author": "xbread31", "text": "Sounds like you are talking about binary search tree, which are different from binary trees.
