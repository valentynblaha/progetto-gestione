This will help you evaluate when to follow a particular tuto or simply read the documentation of a particular language for a particular topic.\n\n\n\nThat been said, IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER, there's nothing against the teacher who seem to demonstrate nothing but good intention, nor against this channel since it offers a considerable amount of real good tutos in here.
