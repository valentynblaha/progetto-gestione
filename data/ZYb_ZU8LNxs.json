In the final way with async and await, why does the setTimeout only need the arguments in a () rather than the usual arrow function. And, when I was redoing this, rather than doing the await like this: \n        await time(1000) \r\n        console.log(\"Step one\")\n\nI did it like this by mistake: \n\nawait time(1000, ()=> console.log(\"step one\")\n\nAnd everything still worked.

Church leaders likely chose this date to coincide with pagan festivals held on or around the winter solstice.\n\nGift-giving, feasting, partying: The Encyclopedia Americana says: \u201cSaturnalia, a Roman feast celebrated in mid-December, provided the model for many of the merry-making customs of Christmas. From this celebration, for example, were derived the elaborate feasting, the giving of gifts, and the burning of candles.\u201d The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica notes that \u201call work and business were suspended\u201d during Saturnalia.\n\nChristmas lights: According to The Encyclopedia of Religion, Europeans decorated their homes \u201cwith lights and evergreens of all kinds\u201d to celebrate the winter solstice and to combat evil spirits.\n\nMistletoe, holly: \u201cThe Druids ascribed magical properties to the mistletoe in particular. The evergreen holly was worshiped as a promise of the sun\u2019s return.\u201d\u2014The Encyclopedia Americana.\n\nChristmas tree: \u201cTree worship, common among the pagan Europeans, survived after their conversion to Christianity.\u201d One of the ways in which tree worship survived is in the custom of \u201cplacing a Yule tree at an entrance or inside the house in the midwinter holidays.\u201d\u200b\u2014Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.\n\nhttps://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/bible-about-christmas/", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwDIbG5DlUWz2xOWIF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-30T20:40:21Z", "author": "notyourNormaldev", "text": "I have to stop the lecture in the middle... to make u know that this guy deserves an award for his teaching..love his enthusiasm", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwq8v31cZJZk02YqKh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-30T11:08:22Z", "author": "Jon\u00e1\u0161 Ulrych", "text": "I like how lively this teacher is.
