I respect the author and also the snake game is beautiful, but the code is littered with unreadable functions and so many globals and they just keep saying \"there's a better way but I didn't use\", honestly, if a developer doesn't use something, it means it wasn't \"developer's time friendly\" or it could probably make things even worse and less readable.

I haven't thought about the problem enough to come up with this elegant solution. \n \nI'll try to reimplement your solution with elm if I have time.", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "cepi24", "text": "I ve seen Chris coding walks and this is great too", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "John Rambo", "text": "Is it a porn video cover on the wall or my eyes deceives me?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Avisek Das", "text": "JavaScript isn't a functional programming language.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Hidden Hand", "text": "Thank you for doing this!
