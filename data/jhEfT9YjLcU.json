My search that brings me to your video at this time is to find a way to post an HTML virtual exhibit to an HTML widget.  It begins with \"object\" but requires \"iframe.\"  Without changing the HTML code, I know that there is an HTML code sentence that one can implement prior to such an \"object\" HTML code, but I don't know it.
