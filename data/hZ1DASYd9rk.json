It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history  to invest as so many don't back up their  crypto assets.More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.I have made over 13 btc 4rm day tradn with Larry Jim insights and signals in less than 4 weeks,this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.", "likes": 7}, "replies": [{"author": "Honest_Bishop", "text": "@NMC1992 They aren't specifically targeted.
