When we reference \\x\\ later on, it's going to know that's Briana.\n  When we console.log(x), it's going to output \\Briana\\.\n  But be careful - if we put console.log(\\x\\), with the x in quotation marks, it will output the letter \\x\\.\n  What I want you to take away from this video is that variables exist in code, and you can store everything from a simple string all the way up to a function, all within a simple name.", "duration": "PT2M13S", "likes": 0, "views": "17907"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Libretto", "text": "Thankyou so much", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Spyce 110", "text": "I noticed a bug at 0:14", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Chandan Boss", "text": "Thanks", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "NoZoneTechShape", "text": "How acctually work variable in hardware", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mihai Neagu", "text": "Great video explained with developer tools console.\nI am pretty curious about what did you have in last 3 bookmark folders, and especially in  web design resources bookmark folder :D", "likes": 1}}]}
