Wouldn't it be easier to fire off the alert inside the TreeBrowser component?\n\nSuggestion: when importing the json data in App.vue, I don't think it needs to be reactive, right? So instead of putting it inside data(), we could put this.root = root inside created() so Vue doesn't treat the json file as reactive \n\nThanks for the great tutorial :)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgziLNmS5pAzJQIYWgp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-08-24T12:40:33Z", "author": "Mansoor Baig", "text": "Please make video on visual basic.
