Very easy to follow.\n\nI've got a question and a suggestion:\n\nQuestion: why emit the click event to App.vue and send the alert from App.vue? Wouldn't it be easier to fire off the alert inside the TreeBrowser component?\n\nSuggestion: when importing the json data in App.vue, I don't think it needs to be reactive, right? So instead of putting it inside data(), we could put this.root = root inside created() so Vue doesn't treat the json file as reactive \n\nThanks for the great tutorial :)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mansoor Baig", "text": "Please make video on visual basic.
