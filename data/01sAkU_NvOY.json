For example, CV2 is just a wrap from the c++ library; Python makes it simple for very high-level programmers/nonprogrammers to pass parameters or achieve what the library allows you to do. However, you will be stuck if you really want to learn about computer vision and create something outside of the library capability. In that case, I suggest reading and understanding the different technics and all the intricacies of it, such as image classification and object detection, etc., before jumping into coding on Python. As most of the libraries are just wrapped from c++, Python is mainly used to interface with high-performance libraries in a human-friendly way.
