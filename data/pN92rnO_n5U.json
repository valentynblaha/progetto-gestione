you study ux design? i am a ux design student, in my course i am learning about how to conduct research, make wireframes and prototypes and then how to test those things, it is a broad subject, since you are a developer knowing basic ux design will definitely help you in visualizing products, there is a course by google on coursera right now, when i first thought about making apps and websites, i had no idea the amount of work that has to be put in the designing phase, the course i am doing is divided into seven parts, i am about half done, as i progress i am learning lots of techniques used by professionals, after i finish this course i am hoping to earn some money by doing design work, then afterwards i plan to learn coding as well, i actually wanted to do coding at first, then i realized how important designing is, without a good design i feel there is no point in coding, so i plan to learn everything from start to finish, first how to create a good design and then how to use that design to make something useful.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxi1ijD-A7eI_x5xJZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-09-17T18:10:39Z", "author": "S G", "text": "Thank you so much!
