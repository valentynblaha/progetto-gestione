Just put a breakpoint (press F9) on the Launch Character node and hover with the mouse over the input of the Sign node to see what it looks like. The value I saw for the first hit was -75 (which is the distance between the location of the hit and the center of the ball, aka the radius). The difference between \"with sign\" and \"without sign\" is just that in the first case you're always adding the same launch velocity to the character (i.e. a <(+/-) 800, 0, 1400> vector), while in the second case the X component depends on the distance between the center of the ball and the hit position. In this game there is no difference since the ball is spherical and every hit will always be at the same distance, but it may not always be the case. So, if you multiply by a value like \"12\" instead of \"800\" after sign and don't normalize the vector, the jump would work roughly the same, while in other cases (say you are playing as a car, or a spaceship, or another irregular form) you will want to take the direction of the hit in a normalized form in order to consistently apply the same hit.\n\nAnother way to see this is: you take the \"hit vector\" composed like this: <ActorLocation.X - HitResult.X, 0, 0> and \"normalize\" it to get a vector that is either <-1, 0, 0> or <1, 0, 0>.", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugzwe4GpilJsMomA0SJ4AaABAg.9OXCIVUjoAy9epSapF3KHz", "publishedAt": "2022-08-17T11:15:27Z", "author": "Nightflash28", "text": "Here's the short version: the \"sign\" function returns either \"1\" or \"-1\".

Basically the links are just broken. You have to relink them from the texture library. There are 5 texture sample boxes that need relinked. One traces back from the Normal, replace it with \"T_Tech_Hex_Tile_N\". The others are much more confusing, but one has a plug going into the multiply block that heads over to the emission plug. That's your emission mask. Use Bloom_Mask for that one. Plug the tilable texture into the one coming directly off the red TexCoordinate node. I plugged the Spec_Texture into the node that plugs into ambient oclusion. The last one I used the Bloom mask again. Not sure if that one is right, but my ball looks like his at this point, so I'm guessing it's okay.
