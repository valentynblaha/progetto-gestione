When people cheat in any arena, they diminish themselves-they threaten their own self-esteem and their relationships with others by undermining the trust they have in their ability to succeed and in their ability to be true. Cheating is the most disrespectful thing one human being can do to another. If you aren\u2019t happy in a relationship, end it before starting another one. Those who cheat on their partners who are loyal to them; don\u2019t deserve them. It is a trashy attitude to disrespect a person who is loyal in a relationship, by cheating on him or her. If you succeed in cheating someone, don\u2019t think that the person is a fool realize that the person trusted you much, more than you deserve.
