After graduation, we spent 5 years in a long-distance relationship. I stayed in New York to work and go to grad school while he went to Washington state to work on a submarine for the US Navy. He was deployed five times. This was the hardest point in our relationship. We could write emails occasionally, but other than that, there\u2019s no communication on a submarine. But, I knew that if we could get through that, we could get through anything. And we did. We finally got married, and the Navy moved us to Hawaii. I called this our \u201ctwo-year honeymoon\u201d because we were finally together and in the paradise of all places! We got to make up for a lost time. I was worried it would be difficult for us to go from hardly ever seeing each other to living together, in a new place where neither of us knew anyone. But starting over like that really helped us bond. After a few years, he had to go back on a submarine. We spent a lot of time apart during those years even though we \u201clived\u201d in the same place. In the military, similar to long-distance relationships, the lows can be low but the highs are so high. For me, the high was visiting Nick on a port call in Guam. And there is no better feeling than that homecoming hug. I wouldn\u2019t have had these amazing experiences without the hard parts that came with them.

When people cheat in any arena, they diminish themselves-they threaten their own self-esteem and their relationships with others by undermining the trust they have in their ability to succeed and in their ability to be true. Cheating is the most disrespectful thing one human being can do to another. If you aren\u2019t happy in a relationship, end it before starting another one. Those who cheat on their partners who are loyal to them; don\u2019t deserve them. It is a trashy attitude to disrespect a person who is loyal in a relationship, by cheating on him or her. If you succeed in cheating someone, don\u2019t think that the person is a fool realize that the person trusted you much, more than you deserve.
