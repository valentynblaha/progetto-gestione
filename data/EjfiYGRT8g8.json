I'll give you a hint how you can do that.. What you want is when the whole DOMcontent is loaded you want to hide the preloader.. but before that you want to show the div which has this loading animation.. If you are little familiar with JavaScript i would suggest you to think just a little and you find the solution.. if not I'll show you the exact code how to do it :) But my suggestion would be to take the hint and give a try so that you will never forget the logic cz you have actually gave it a thought \ud83d\ude0a", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Srujan Mhase", "text": "The IT Guy fantastic video man! Just one question, how do you integrate this code in a webpage so that it actually shows up only when the page is loading? Thanks :)", "likes": 1}]}]}
