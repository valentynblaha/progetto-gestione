Seriously folks there have been ten thousand 'hello world' 'tutorials' past ten years. Let's consider that most adults don't live in a cartoon world and most developers no matter what level they are at want to create apps that someone would pay them to create. Apps that would actually be used in a real business. This means apps that have input with the front-end and connects to a database backend.

Loved it. Thank you for putting it together. \nSome small issues: As others have pointed out \"Correct Index\" needed at \"1:31\" is discussed out of sequence at \"1:41\". \nAlso, shouldn't the v-for loop in the component QuestionBox be over this.shuffledAnswers rather than answers?\nAlso, loved the fact that you make errors, show us code inspection methods using dev-tools/inspect.

Unless you want to read through all the files or pass them through a static code analysis tool (which you have to trust is going to catch anything malicious) you are trusting that not only is the package you pulled in clean but any packages that package is pulling is clean and so and so forth. Which is why you should be very careful about what packages you decide you need.\n\n\nHowever this is a security issue for any package distribution network including any sources you have mounted in apt. You have to trust that there is enough people maintaining a package that nothing is going to slip through and if it does that it gets patched quickly.\n\n\nOf course you can take the same approach with npm as you can with apt and self host a registry for your organization and dedicate individuals to checking patches/packages and pushing them through to your registry manually after passing review.

The reason why I ask is that you are using VUE Version 3.1.1 and I am doing it with VUE Version 3.5.1 and the bootstrap version that you show at 43:26 is v2.0.0-rc.13 but the version that I found going to the bootstrap website is v2.0.0-rc.15 . Also the reason why I ask is that I am new to VUE and the type of work that it does or covers or its area. I don't know what the right term/word is but I am new to it. I have already done the tutorial or crash course that \rTraversy Media created in this link: https://youtu.be/Wy9q22isx3U .That went into some detail. I was still confused on some things and wanted another tutorial that I could watch that teaches it another away or gives a different example. So thats how I found this video. So I was just wondering by my question above about the date that this was recorded or made does it effect these new versions that I am using or no.  Also if you could put in the description or somewhere in the beginning that the versions used may be different than what is out their currently or something sort of like that. Because in my opinion, as a learner, seeing that this video was published or released on youtube on March 19, 2019 and when you are watching it seeing that they are using VUE Version 3.1.1 and bootstrap v2.0.0-rc.13 when me as the learner is using VUE Version 3.5.1 and bootstrap v2.0.0-rc.15. Thats a 0.4.0 version difference for VUE and a v0.0.0-rc.02 difference for bootstrap it makes me wonder if some of whats talked about in here will be different than what is actually out their. I still finished the video and it was very helpful with part 1 and explaining vue a bit better and clarifying some of my questions but part 2 made it a bit more harder as a learner because of the version difference and the documentation done on the current version than what version you used. That was about my only question and the concern behind it. \n\n\nI do not intend to be offensive or disrespect the creator of the video at all. I only tried to word my question and concerns in the best way possible but I sometimes can't express it in the right terms or words.
