So the thing is to use OnActorHit.AddDynamic instead of OnComponentOverlapBegin.AddDynamic, OnHit seems way more stable than overlapping. But a thing that he doesn't explain in the video is that the function passed as a parameter in AddDynamic has to have certain parameters that match the event : \n In the video OnOverlapBegin(UPrimitiveComponent * OverlappedComp, AActor * OtherActor, UPrimitiveComponent * OtherComp, int32 OtherBodyIndexType, bool bFromSweep, const FHitResult & SweepResult) has to be replace by OnHit or whatever name you want to call it but it has to have the parameters OnHit(AActor* SelfActor, AActor* OtherActor, FVector NormalImpulse, const FHitResult& Hit).
