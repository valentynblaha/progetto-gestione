Link that to your button, and then whenever you need to console log something, like in the exercises for example, you can just enter the required variable inside console.log() within your function, and then click the button on your app, and, VOILA, console-logged!  \n\nIt's not necessary but it's a nice touch and then you won't have to keep on typing out console.log() for each exercise.

It's beyond the scope of this tutorial; basically 'var' makes a variable available 'anywhere' in the function, but let is only available at the block level.\n\nhere's a basic example:\n\nif (randomCard === 21){ var message = \"  you win \"}\nConsole.log(message)\n\nwhen you get 21, your message will be logged to the console, but, if you did this below (using 'let' instead): \n\nif (randomCard === 21){  let message = \"  you win \"}\r\nConsole.log(message)\nbecause the console.log(message) is outside of the block where the 'let' was used to create a variable, you will get an error telling you that 'message' is undefined. \n\ninstead you would have to do as below:\n\nif (randomCard === 21){ let message = \"  you win \";\r\nConsole.log(message)\n}\n\nSo now, your console.log(message) is INSIDE the block and you will have access to in, because you are console logging from inside the 'block' where the variable is assigned using 'let' \n\nI don't quite understand the differences, and why they are so important, but there are explanations if you search for them. I'm just not at that level yet.  \n\nRegarding the use of semi-colons, I think their use is largely for  'semantic' purposes, it's the end of a statement which is easy to see when you have a semi-colon, but I don't think they are absolutely necessary in JS, as you can see in this lecture.", "likes": 4}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Hama Kurda", "text": "Thank you so much\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mostafa Hussin", "text": "one of the best courses in youtube \nthx\u2764", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Alex mleczko", "text": "great!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "harsh", "text": "please i need html and css version of yours so far 4 hours done and it wasnr boring a bit they way you take class is very interesting if someone knows html and css version of his please let  me know", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Hareesh D", "text": "crazy video, i have finished this in 3 days\n\nthanks", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "STANIS UNFOLD", "text": "God bless Freecode\ni have learnt a lot", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Souvik", "text": "hello, can anyone suggest me as a complete beginner to JS which should I consider? this one or the video which freecodecamp uploaded 2 years ago? thanks.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "LN C", "text": "7:44:20  (Started at 10/12/2021 Ended at 11/10/2021)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mustafa", "text": "I'm just starting this course.
