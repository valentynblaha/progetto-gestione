Just wanted to share my story. I\u2019m currently almost 13 years old. It all started about a year ago, when I was getting bored of quarantine and looking to learn something new. It was then I found out about programming. I did a little research and decided to start learning HTML. I learned from a tutorial on a website, but barely practiced and had a hard time. I decided to quit. When I started 7th grade, I got offered by my school to learn to code at a boot camp. At first, I hesitated. I wasn\u2019t sure if coding was for me. I decided to give it another try and to go to the boot camp. At the boot camp, we started learning the basics of C and I started to enjoy programming. I would make all sorts of projects and show them to my family. After learning C for several months, the boot camp moved on to Python, which I\u2019m currently still learning. I enjoy coding in Python even more than coding in C because I can make cooler projects in Python more easily than in C. It is currently summer vacation, so I have time to watch tutorials, learn from websites and read books about programming. I forgot to mention that most of what I know wasn\u2019t taught by the boot camp. I learned it by myself by watching tutorials on YouTube and searching on Google. My advice for any self taught developer is to practice a lot", "likes": 72}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "daniela guzman", "text": "I'm learning to code with freecodecamp. it's one of the most useful website I've ever found to learn to code. i totally recommend it", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "KakSource", "text": "I will come back with feedback when i get a job as software developer", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Seagull", "text": "@KakSource Did you ever get a job?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "KakSource", "text": "@Talson Hacks Haha! thank you!!, good luck to you, too!", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Talson Hacks", "text": "@KakSource lol, it is an idiom which means \"Good luck!\"", "likes": 1}, {"author": "KakSource", "text": "@Talson Hacks Lol, why!?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Talson Hacks", "text": "Break a leg!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Alex Platt", "text": "3 weeks learning...", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "stevebob240", "text": "This is inspiring, I'm learning through freeCodeCamp and other resources.
