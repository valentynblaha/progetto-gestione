Thank you for the tutorial. Thank you for taking the time to do this Gwen!\n\nEdit: Upon reviewing the tutorial again, I'd like to say:\n\n1. When creating a tutorial, you guys should _truly_ understand the importance of slowing down to the pace of the learner. In the beginning you walk us through a nice set of key terms (which was exceptional), then start mixing lots of advanced and beginner-level concepts together in your explanations, confusing the person that's watching the video. Slow down, explain like we're 5, that's why we're here.\n\n2. To expand upon the issue of mixing things up I mentioned above, it's okay to keep a tutorial short, and add footnotes later if you think that the advanced concepts you're touching on are still worth being aware of. That way, the beginner can truly focus their attention on the basics, and then access the footnote only when they feel comfortable with the knowledge they've acquired thus far, making the content of your footnotes even more effective. After all, isn't good programming about being efficient? \n\nI used to get annoyed at being expected to take additional English classes as a Computer Science student, but now I understand why. I spent 4 hours yesterday debugging a Terminal issue, only to later realize that there was an \"issue\" because the person who created the how-to GitHub document instructed the reader to paste this code into the Terminal command line: \n\n*eval \"$(ssh-agent exec -s)\"*\n\nThey said to *paste* this command in the terminal (meaning: include the quotation marks). After 4 hours of learning about chmod, File Links, Groups, root directory, Inodes\u2014things I knew NOTHING about prior to this, I resolved my problem by simply removing the quotation marks. \n\nNow, the arrogant developer might say, \"Well that's obvious\". No it's not! The person said \"paste\", meaning I would: \n\n- Select the piece of code\n- Apply ctrl+c to it, for Windows (cmd+c on Mac)\n- Go to the Terminal and apply ctrl+v/cmd+v\n\nEither the tutorial should have been made like this: \n\n*eval $(ssh-agent exec -s)* ,  \n\nor the person writing the document should I mentioned that the quotation marks need to be removed. \n\nAs Software Engineering becomes more collaborative, programmers can no longer get away with being asocial, and communication impaired, so this is an area a lot more engineers need to start being proficient in .", "likes": 94}, "replies": [{"author": "Souquest`.\u00b4", "text": "I got stuck on the same part, still the command is not recognized by powershell, I could do without the auto-agent what not but... yeah, feel you.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Nuwa H.
