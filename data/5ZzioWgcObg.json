The web development is the what.\n\nToday we're going to discuss how they work together to build a beautiful experience for you and everyone else that visits the internet.\n\nThe web designer, what they do will impact the 'How' the UI and UX looks and feels.\n\nThe web developer, what they do will impact 'What' the UX and UI will do once you start to click on buttons. \n\nAn example is the login process.\n\nA designer will decide where the login process will start on the page.\n\nA developer will decide what that process will entail. Are you logging in with your email address, username or social media account?\n\nAnother example is building a car. A designer will choose what color the car is. Is it red, white, or blue? Cloth or leather seats? Tinted windows?\n\nA developer will decide if it's a V6 or V8 engine. Is it a gasoline, hybrid\nor all electric vehicle?\n\nTogether, they work to build a beautiful experience for you and everyone else that visits the internet. \n\nAgain, a web designer is the how and the web developer is the what.\n\n-\n\nWe're busy people who learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits. Learn Full-stack JavaScript, build a portfolio, and get great references with our open source community.\n\nJoin our community at http://freecodecamp.com\n\nFollow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=freecodecamp\n\nFollow us on Twitch: twitch.tv/freecodecamp\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp\n\nFollow Quincy on Quora: http://www.quora.com/Quincy-Larson", "duration": "PT1M50S", "likes": 0, "views": "3533"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "John Mix", "text": "Thanks!!!", "likes": 0}}]}
