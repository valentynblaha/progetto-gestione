Create a Definition of Ready to establish reasonable guidelines as to what conditions need to be met before you pull a user story into a sprint or begin work on it.

I'm doing a deep dive on the proper elements of a \"User Story\". \n\nQuestion: What's your thoughts on Story Points vs Hour Estimates? I feel like hour estimates are more powerful because they can achieve both the weight and length of a user story at the same time. What do you think?", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Justin O'Neill", "text": "@Chris Gagn\u00e9 3 years later, but i've been using Story Points over hours and it makes total sense.

This was carried further by folks like Mike Cohn who invented Planning Poker. I'll probably make an explainer video about this because it's a contentious issue for many teams and I've got a lot more to say about this, so look forward to more in the near future! :)\n\nOne thought: keep in mind that we are trying to develop cross-functional teams. What may takes one person 8 hours might take another person 4 or 40. How does this account for pairing or mobbing? How does this account for highly complex or uncertain tasks?\n\nAnother thought: you can increase the number of story points your team completes in a sprint. Can you increase the number of hours you complete in a sprint? :)", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "erick garcia", "text": "cool video, thx", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"author": "Chris Gagn\u00e9", "text": "<3", "likes": 0}]}]}
