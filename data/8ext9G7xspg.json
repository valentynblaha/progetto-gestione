Like the set function, it wasn't explained in the 4 hour intro lesson to python while it's a mega important function. (A set is a data structure similar to a list but they only contain unique values. Sets use curly brackets like dictionaries. To manage elements (add & remove) of a set you can use .add or .remove. Set data is also unordered which makes indexing impossible (e.g. the useful enumerate function).

After some thought (and trial and error), I think I somewhat understand how it works. Not entirely sure if it's what you're asking but let me try to explain it (with my very limited Python/programming knowledge). So maybe take it with half a pinch of salt :p also it's gonna be a pretty scuffed explanation so bear with me and let me know where I can try to explain further. I'll be using asterisks (*) to denote the starts and ends of a line.\n\nSo the line in question is *word_list = [letter if letter in used_letters else '-' for letter in word]*.\n\nFirstly, a line like \"x for x in variable\" essentially summons each item within the variable. In this case, \"letter for letter in word\" summons, as you might guess, each letter of the word. To illustrate, if you were to replace the original line with *word_list = [letter for letter in word]*, the program would instead print out each letter in the word right from the get-go, instead of the \"-\" in the original code.\n\nNow because we need to hide the letters at the start and also subsequently the un-guessed letters as the game progresses, instead of using \"letter for letter in word\", we want to print a dash (-) for each letter in the word instead. Thus there is a part in the code that says \" '-'  for letter in word\", which basically replaces each letter with a dash instead ('-' for letter in word). However, we need the correct letter to show up if it has been guessed correctly. This is where the whole line comes together.\n\n!!!KEY PART!!!: To break the original line of code down, you may understand the line *word_list = [letter if letter in used_letters else '-' for letter in word]* as: \nif the letter that the user has input (used_letters) AND is part of the word (in word), summon the correct letter for the letter that has been input (letter... for letter in word). Otherwise, summon a dash for each letter (else '-' for letter in word).\n\nNote that there are lines of code (as below) that add the letter that the user has just input into used_letters. So these lines kinda work together to make this line function as it does. The lines, just for your info, are:\n*if user_letter in alphabet - used_letters:\r\n            used_letters.add(user_letter)*\n\r\nFinally, just note that this square bracket thing \"[ ]\" is used to create lists. So the line creates a list. \r\nI'm not too sure of the significance of this... maybe it affects how the word_list is printed? ... But the key parts should be above heheh.\r\n\n\nExample: Word is \"J A R\".\nEach time the user inputs a letter, say \"J\", that letter gets added to the set of used_letters. Since the word also happens to contain \"J\", \"J\" gets added into the list word_list. Meanwhile, \"A\" and \"R\" are in the word but not in the set of used_letters. \nSo Python will print the list word_list with \"J\" for \"J\", \"-\" for \"A\", and also \"-\" for \"R\". \n\nLet me know if anything is confusing (as I suspect is the case)!\n\r\n\r\n*If any experts see this and would care to correct me where I may have erred or missed out, please do! Or even to put forth a better explanation. Any input would be greatly appreciated :)", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzXIBkGfKsEn5BqTb14AaABAg.9cuXp5FGFKO9dhDst53FWg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-20T10:01:31Z", "author": "Jovan Tan", "text": "@P K Hello!

I have a model that returns an output in csv. the data is sorted in the following way (Just an example):\nIt has three columns:\nTechnology Price Year\n\nEach of the technology names just continue down in the same column, just changing names when a new technology is represented. The years are for a 20 year period, but if a technology does not have a price in a given year, that row is not displayed. So some technologies appear 20 times with 20 prices, other maybe 15 times with 15 prices.\n\nExample:\nTechnology Price Year\r\nBMW 56000 1997\nBMW 57000 1998\nBMW 56500 1999\nAUDI 47500 1997\nAUDI 49000 1999\netc.\n\nHow can I plot all the technologies together (BMW, AUDI, MERCEDES etc..) with their prices in one graph with the years 1997-2017 for example? So that they are correctly displayed even if AUDI does not have a value for 1998 for example. \nI have tried a lot with pandas and stuff but I can't seem to make it work.
