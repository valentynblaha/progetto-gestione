{"video": {"id": "1EUwWiED1II", "title": "The Future is Serverless: What That Means for Node.js", "description": "Serverless computing is sweeping the cloud industry and transforming how we're building applications on the cloud. Node.js has been the first language each of the major serverless providers has supported from day 1. Node.js applications written for serverless are changing from their \"server\"ed past. We'll discuss why serverless went Node.js first, what impact this will have on Node.js developers, and finally, what consequences this might have on Node.js's ecosystem.\n\nTalk given by Chris Anderson at Node Summit 2017.\n\nThanks to Node Summit for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
