Perhaps use larger font when showing code?\n2) When you move to a terminal, all we see is a blue screen at first.  Why not just use the terminal in VS Code which is already on your screen?\n3) What is 'Postman'?  I'd never heard of it, so I did some searching and found out.  You, on the other hand, assumed everyone had it installed or even could install it.\n4) If you are going to use a tool that only works on Windows, Mac, or Linux on a (amd64, i386) architecture, perhaps you should say so up front.  I'm running Linux on an ARM64 core and finding out I can't use the tutorial after an hour of coding is really annoying.\n5) Kind a repeat of item 3... When you mentioned prerequisites, you mentioned GoLang and nothing else.  The 'Postman' agent needs to be run locally for it to work that makes it a prerequisite.  Just saying.  For that matter, you have to have a MYSQL server running for one of your tutorials...  This is a VERY common issue with what freeCodeCamp.org produces.\n\nI've just started learning Go and was excited to see this tutorial.  My mistake.\n\nThat said, the fact that he produces a structural diagram of the project before he starts is wonderful.  This is absolutely necessary in a 'beginners' tutorial and not nearly enough tutorials have it.
