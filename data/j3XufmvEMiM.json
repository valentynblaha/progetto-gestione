I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called \u201cFischer Random Chess,\u201d where the starting position of the pieces is \u201crandomized\u201d to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0\r\n\r\nBIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw6N4skLXUWyJfruBV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-31T15:52:45Z", "author": "Coding Boot", "text": "Which software used to create this video?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwcl4JggGbGRmnsNSV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-13T03:04:19Z", "author": "BackOffer", "text": "Ah yes, sits in Iraq", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyUeGhkobfbVJDSWit4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-02T06:43:10Z", "author": "Sahil", "text": "Bruh This solved all of my Doubts\nyou saved me a lot of hassle", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgypcodY85H-kpsrGtJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-15T01:48:05Z", "author": "Mohamed Lemine Ahmed Yacine", "text": "I had been struggling for a long time to understand what's microservices mean. thank you, keep it up", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyRxF8dSFzV2dZghD54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-05T05:51:14Z", "author": "Gerry Wowiling", "text": "the subtitle tho..which sits in Iraq, i almost laugh  \"a rack\" become Iraq", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyMf6n7xd7aoiL5Wzp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-04T07:44:55Z", "author": "n k", "text": "\"which runs on server.. which sits on IRAQ' this is what the subtitle says..
