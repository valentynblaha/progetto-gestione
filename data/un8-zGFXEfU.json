However, within the context of the analogy she was making, she's just saying that for a developer who is focusing on, say, making an API backend, or, making a frontend SPA, or even both, your job should be to get as good as possible at that, and shouldn't be worrying about Apache, Nginx, securing, configuring, provisioning, sharding, scaling, etc. It's just more division of labor and efficiency. It's not dumbing things down, it's just a way for developers to focus on a particular layer, and it saves the businesses they are developing for A TON of money. We don't write our own compilers, yet it's still good to know what they are and how they work in a basic sense. But if we are freed from having to write them, that's so much better than having to. Same with Function as a Service. It has its limitations and gotchas, to be sure, but it's definitely worth checking out when you get the chance.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxo5CVGNrgbgvU2Hg54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-05-05T20:10:19Z", "author": "Marco Ant\u00f4nio", "text": "I've seen that u're working as a fullstack developer at rovio, I'm right?

I didn't understand until about 2 minutes in. It felt a lot like talk about water and a picture of tomatoes. Then at 2 minutes in, a brief sentence about what serverless is. I suppose now I will google what that term means.\n\nSo, for those people who didn't get as much as wanted from this video: \n\nHere's a link to the wikipedia article:  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing\n\nBriefly: Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. It is a form of utility computing.\n\nAlso Martin Fowler starts talking about Serverless as applications that significantly depend on third-party services for the backend. known as Backend as a Service or \"BaaS\". Or or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or \"FaaS\").\n\nHere's more Martin Fowler:\nhttps://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy5d1wjnkpIQjLll054AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-05-04T23:10:15Z", "author": "dragonhunter250utub", "text": "at 5:27 you get the point of the video, serverless, serverless, serverless...
