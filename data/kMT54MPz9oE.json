Sorry it took me so long. I don't get notifications for this video since it isn't on my channel, so I sometimes fall behind on replying. Divs are really useful for when you need to layout and style specific sections of content on your site. They should be used when there is no other HTML element such as header or footer that makes sense in that scenario.\n\nAlso, I personally feel that classes should be used in most scenarios for styling different HTML elements. Here is my Learn CSS in 20 Minutes video. I go into a bit more depth on using classes vs ids vs elements for selecting elements.
