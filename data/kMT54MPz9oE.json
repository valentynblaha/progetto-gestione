You will then want to move onto learning about frontend frameworks such as React, or Angular. You will also need to have a strong understanding of Ajax, and knowing how to build a single page application would be useful but not required. You will also want to learn jQuery since it is used in many older systems, as well as bundlers like Webpack which are used in newer systems.", "likes": 4}, {"author": "Mohammed Fachihul Alam", "text": "Thanks for your prompt response.what should i learn to be a front- end  developer?", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Software engineering", "text": "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Web Dev Simplified", "text": "I'm really glad you enjoyed the video!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Yasser AKBBACH", "text": "That was amazing!\nI'm wondering why didn't you work with tables!?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Juke 2016 Nissan", "text": "@Web Dev Simplified This JS video in your link is also one of the best ones in YT, I'm learning so much from you, keep sharing your knowledge bro, you're a star!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Yasser AKBBACH", "text": "Watching...\nThank u", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Web Dev Simplified", "text": "I feel that this course covers almost everything you need to know about HTML and CSS to get started.
