His original intention was to have a solid and living relationship with each of us.  However, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the garden of Eden, their sins created a barrier between us and God.  We are separated from Him forever.\n Instead of allowing us to continue to distance ourselves from Him, God created a perfect plan for recovery\u2014one motivated by His infinite love and mercy for us.  The goal of His plan is to completely restore even the most intimate aspects of His relationship with mankind as it existed before Adam and Eve sinned.\n More than 2,000 years ago, God sent His Son to earth to remove the barrier caused by sin and make salvation available to all.\n \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  For God sent his Son into the world, not to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.\u201d  John 3:16-17\n Through his death and resurrection, Jesus paid the full penalty of sin on our behalf and removed the barrier between us and God.  This forgiveness is available to all who fully accept Him as their Savior.\n But this is just the beginning.  Before completing His time on earth to join His Father in Heaven, Jesus described to His disciples another important element of God's larger plan.  to completely restore humanity to Himself:\n \u201cIn my Father's house (Heaven) there are many dwelling places;  otherwise, I would have told you.  I'll go and prepare a place for you.  When I have gone, and have prepared a place for you, I will return and take you with me, that where I am, there you may also be.\"  John 14:2-3\n\n God not only sent Jesus to remove the barrier of sin, but one day in the future, Jesus will return to bring all believers \u201chome\u201d to be with Him forever.  .\n The Bible says: The time of the fulfillment of the kingdom of God is near, so Repent and Receive the Good News.  \" ...", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u24c2\ufe0fSECUREWEB247\ud83d\udc8cOn Instagram", "text": "*\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffdYOUR ACT OF KINDNESS AND THE WAY YOU RENDER YOUR SERVICE SHOWS THAT\nYOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING*", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u24c2\ufe0fSECUREWEB247\ud83d\udc8cOn Instagram", "text": "*\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffdYOUR ACT OF KINDNESS AND THE WAY YOU RENDER YOUR SERVICE SHOWS THAT\nYOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING*", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u24c2\ufe0fSECUREWEB247\ud83d\udc8cOn Instagram", "text": "*\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffdYOUR ACT OF KINDNESS AND THE WAY YOU RENDER YOUR SERVICE SHOWS THAT\nYOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING*", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Zach Zeurcher", "text": "When I did Truffle compile I got: Could not find /Users/Zach1/eth-todo-list/contracts/TodoList.sol from any sources", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "yardtools on Instagram", "text": "A genius \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 who turns my non spendable bitcoins into what I\u2019m spending right now \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0b.

A las ballenas que poseen la billetera btc autohospedada les resulta dif\u00edcil venderla sin hacer KYC y, en algunos casos, esto puede conducir a la bancarrota financiera. Las personas pierden el acceso a sus billeteras BTC, lo que hace que BTC se congele para siempre. Hype y FOMO est\u00e1n en aumento y la mayor\u00eda de las personas solo compran y almacenan con btc. Quiero decir, tienes que entender que los fundamentos normales del mercado de valores no se aplican aqu\u00ed. No es un escenario de 2017 o 2018. La regulaci\u00f3n agregada a BTC podr\u00eda incluso hacerlo m\u00e1s deseable (aunque tiene un inconveniente). B\u00e1sicamente, cualquier cosa que pueda evitar que BTC sea inmolado ser\u00edan restricciones regulatorias extremas y tambi\u00e9n mejores oportunidades de inversi\u00f3n descubiertas por los propietarios de BTC. Sin embargo, el mejor consejo es encontrar una estrategia de trabajo diario/se\u00f1ales que funcione bien en otros para acumular y hacer crecer una cartera muy solida por delante. He estado operando con las se\u00f1ales y la estrategia diarias de la Srta. Deborah Martin, su orientaci\u00f3n hace que el comercio sea menos estresante y m\u00e1s rentable a pesar de las fluctuaciones recientes.
