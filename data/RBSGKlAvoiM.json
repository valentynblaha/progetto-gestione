I got confused because I thought it means \"what should come after the node being removed\" (with \"after\" being w.r.t the in-order traversal order) - which is completely wrong, because if it were that, then the successor would always-always be in the right sub-tree, yet as you then point out, it can actually be in either/both. The problem is that this is NOT exactly the definition of what \"successor\" means - it's NOT the one that comes after the node being removed - but rather, the one that comes after \"the 'predecessor' of the node being removed\"(!) So now you have to define \"predecessor\", again, in terms of in-order traversal. This is a pretty easy to get confused about, so it shouldn't be glossed-over. I think a better way to describe it, is instead of in terms of \"successor\"/\"predecessor\", you simply ask: \n\"Of all the nodes in both sub-trees of the node being removed, which would be valid to be placed instead of it?\"\nThis would more-closely follow the notion of the invariant being maintain, and also completely side-step the notions of \"predecessor\"/\"successor\" and traversal orders and the need to define those.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw0y876ntdrxc5XZnR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-10-28T18:30:16Z", "author": "Inderjit Saini", "text": "can anyone explain what this means :\narr = (T[]) new Object [Capacity] and also what is Iterable <T>, why we use it here?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyZVLljzsHnYOKFZLx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-10-21T16:04:54Z", "author": "gabrielrfg", "text": "Watching this to prepare myself for interviews after finishing my degree in CS.

Hence 1 + 30 0s + 1 is -(2^31 -1). If we wanna take the absolute value, normalizeIndex should return 2^31 - 1, which would be 0 + 31 1s.\nBut, ur normalizeIndex() method would return 0 + 30 0s + 1 = 1.\nI guess the normalizeIndex(keyHash) method should return the 2s complement of input parameter whenever the sign bit is 1.
