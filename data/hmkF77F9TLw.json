Knowing attack vectors basically never hurts, even if they are not currently used in any campaign or commodity malware.\n\nBasically, it's like \" not dying\": just because we are not exposed to certain dangers as much these days, doesn't mean that we should lightly expose ourselves to them or even ignore them.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Kantan Coding", "text": "Hey!
