If there is no ORM, it can't cause trouble and it can't be exploited.\n\nFurthermore, security vulnerabilities have no expiry date. They can and often are patched, but far too often they are not, for various reasons. Knowing attack vectors basically never hurts, even if they are not currently used in any campaign or commodity malware.\n\nBasically, it's like \" not dying\": just because we are not exposed to certain dangers as much these days, doesn't mean that we should lightly expose ourselves to them or even ignore them.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxO_VhWm0bvJ1M1n8N4AaABAg.9iDnAujsDbi9iHpnUzpS7D", "publishedAt": "2022-11-11T10:39:03Z", "author": "Kantan Coding", "text": "Hey!

I\u2019d have to disagree with you there as there are many reasons why one would choose not to use an ORM. As you already mentioned, my focus was the overall architecture.
