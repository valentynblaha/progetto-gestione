But forgive me if i sound a bit rude but watching this feels like you jumped into this without a greater understanding of unity specifically. Its kinda like bringing old practices into a new environment and there are definitely areas that can be improved which i'm sure that you already have improved on seeing as this video is a year and a half old now.  \n\nEDIT: There are some things you do that are definitely great too.
