The problem is, the browsers default way to display a broken image is really ugly. You can fix that and actually use it as an opportunity to enhance the user's experience on your web pages with CSS! That's what you will learn about in this lesson.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fFiles you need \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udcbbUseful Broken Images Code: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1pceu4wvrzadsgg/AACHHW3sJMJrcCI5B5eazAnga?dl=0\n\ud83d\udcbbAll tutorials in this series need this \"_theme-styles\" directory (only download once): https://www.dropbox.com/sh/890hx6ke34oovaz/AAByJ-jb-H5pWuIUx7t_GvQqa?dl=0\n\nThis video works as a stand-alone tutorial but is also day 5 of CSS3 in 30 Days.

I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called \u201cFischer Random Chess,\u201d where the starting position of the pieces is \u201crandomized\u201d to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0\r\n\r\nBIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mukesh Kumar", "text": "I\u00a0tried\u00a0multiple\u00a0times,\u00a0but\u00a0these\u00a0styles\u00a0are\u00a0not\u00a0working.\u00a0\ud83d\ude14", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Hu\u1ef3nh L\u1ee3i Nguy\u1ec5n", "text": "He looks like David Beckham, doesn't he?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Fahad Khan Chughtai", "text": "I am following your series and I must say its helping me a lot in learning. \nThanks Brad.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Cindy Mora", "text": "Awesome tip for future projects!

Adding an image width or height breaks the design and you can never be quite certain the 'not found part' will not  overlap some element of the page. It's too bad there is no CSS general support for styling the not found image, I would have thought at least a CSS selector for ::notfound or ::loaderror would have been obvious for such a common scenario. (something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21149286/4572240 )\n\nAlso, I though you should explain why this doesn't break images that load correctly, as many others notices. \n\nThanks for the series, it's nice.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Alex Ci", "text": "what if the noimage.png failed to download too?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Curiosity House", "text": "well, in that case, I think it's better to create a custom icon with css", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Srikant Kumar", "text": "Please  do one video on explaining pseudo elements", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "BenRangel", "text": "In my opinion, it can be dangerous to over-style your broken image placeholders. It's so unusual. Users are so accustomed to having the default broken images, that they might not even understand custom ones. They might think that a custom placeholder is the actual image, and that it's a fake image / joke image, rather than a broken link.\n\nYou might actually miss out on some bug reports too, since people might not think of these images as \"broken\" any more.", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Danilo Novakovi\u0107", "text": "I love this series, really what i need.
