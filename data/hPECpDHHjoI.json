Instead of a traditional top-down presentation of Python's features, syntax, and semantics, students are immersed in the language bottom-up with hundreds of small examples using the interactive interpreter to quickly gain familiarity with most of the core language features. Special attention is given to concepts in Python that often trip up those new to the language.\n\nTalk given by Stuart Williams at PyCon 2018.\n\nThanks to PyCon for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
