In the video you say take the line out but it should be the whole section and it cuts to being rmeoved but is very hard to see.\n3) It would be great if the SQL Database was tidied up with the vaa length set to 40, the DB creation part removed and for the DB entry a comment like <REPLACE WITH YOUR CHARGE ID> which someone could do a replace on. ( If you cut the Craete Sales order part out of teh SQL you can still do a find and replace ) \n4) On the sending an email section if you are using Google Workspace you will need to enable unsecure application access for teh isnatnce and then enabe POP & IMAP.
