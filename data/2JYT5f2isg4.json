Once you\u2019ve learned it all, we\u2019ll build a real web crawler using Node.js to put all the concepts into practice.\n\nHTTP is the backbone of the modern web, and in this course we\u2019ll do a deep dive into all of the fundamentals you\u2019ll need to know to master web networking.

The word protocol was derived from the politics. In politics, protocols are an established standard way to approach a country to have access to whatever is needed by another another country. Example, the Prime Minister of UK has to follow a set of protocols to establish contact with the President of the US. Similarly, HTTP is a protocol to be used in order for one technology entity to access the resources of another entity. When we use HTTP to get a web page, we do exactly this. Our browser use a set protocols (HTTP) to establish a communication into another machine to obtain access to a page in that machine.
