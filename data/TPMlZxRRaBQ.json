While\n\r\n % of total is not, as 20-age group represents the majority of the Titanic passengers. Hence wrong conclusion was drawn, as you said in the video, that people in \u201820s and 30s\u2019, have the highest survival rate(about 10%). In reality,  Age \u201810s\u2019 has 50% survival rate,  I can draw a conclusion by a  glance that \u2018female kids under 10 with no siblings or grand parents\u2019 have the highest chance of survival. (it\u2019s quite logic whether we have watched the movie or not, mums with babies were looked after first). \r\nNext Q is, how to create a measure for the 'survived and 'not -survived ' % in each age-bin; \r\nAlso Q2, similar, how to create a measure for the sex(gender) in the % of survival? I think it\u2019s more important than \u2018Class\u2019, \u201cLadies first\u201d in the old days, because gentlemen in the first class will let ladies , regardless of class to get on the safety rafter first. \r\n\r\nOverall, I always love your video, great presentation, I will definitely want to watch more.
