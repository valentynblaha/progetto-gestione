John 3:16-17\n\nJesus is The Son of God who was sent to the earth from Heaven to die on the Cross to save humans from burning in hell FOREVER. He took the punishment who us who deserve to be punished. So since He died and Rose again, we can now be free from hell and He offers us everlasting life meaning to live FOREVER with Him in Heaven or the New Earth. All we have to do to receive this free Gift is to believe in Jesus, believe in that He died for yours sins and believe that He Resurrected (came back to Life) on the third day. Once you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is LORD you will be saved. (Saved from hell). He is coming soon, tomorrow is not a promise so please dont waste time, put your faith in Jesus while there is still time, so you wont have any regrets. Jesus the Only Way, the Truth, and the Life. Once you have Jesus you have everything you need. You have freedom with Jesus. Besides you can see literally see nearly everything the Bible talks about comes through so why doubt when you can see the Truth unfolding in front of our eyes. If you want to know anything at all regarding Jesus you can ask. God Loves you, Jesus Loves you.\n\nhttps://t.co/Z3z5QmW3PE\nHe has never failed me and never will.

Kevin might have opted with '<span>X</span>' because it is much easier to work with in terms of adding styles to those counters and it works on previous browser versions. Something to keep in mind if you use the CSS counter, make sure you have a fallback when a user might be using a different browser than your development environment or they might have a browser that doesn't support CSS counter. That is why it is better to use the older way or css tricks that are proven and stable.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Luella Gomes", "text": "Tell her i referred you to her \u261d\ufe0f", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Luella Gomes", "text": "\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\n      \uff0b\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd2\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfd5\ud835\udfd5\ud835\udfd6\ud835\udfd5\ud835\udfd7\ud835\udfd1\ud835\udfd3\ud835\udfd5", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Leonard Edwards", "text": "This channel is the best\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udd1f", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ronit Chaurasia", "text": "Your channel covered almost every technology except ios development and web 3.
