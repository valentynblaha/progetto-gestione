Very informative.\n\nWanted to point out that there's a mistake when server connections are closed. That way the tutorial is coded, the server will remove the user at the 'index' position -- however, the user closing the connection may be at a different index in the array (after other users open and close connections). You can test it out by opening/closing several windows in random order. You'll start to notice that the windows you're closing do not match the user who opened it.\n\nI fixed this by generating random IDs for each user, and then using this ID to determine which user needs to be removed from the array.\nHere's a gist: https://gist.github.com/diaz-de-berenguer/2aa52ce776ad42a55759ca7c8afe777e", "likes": 10}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwZCe2LNVUXxKpsUqN4AaABAg.8cINBbtx73r8oSjUJSXgrX", "publishedAt": "2018-12-05T01:54:39Z", "author": "Erik Oliveira", "text": "Thanks", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwZCe2LNVUXxKpsUqN4AaABAg.8cINBbtx73r8cQVUJiDset", "publishedAt": "2018-02-08T22:48:22Z", "author": "freeCodeCamp.org", "text": "Awesome!
