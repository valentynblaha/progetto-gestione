It all depends what you need. JavaScript games, for example, call requestAnimationFrame() all the time - no matter if anything changed or not. So there's no single \"correct\" solution. It gets more tricky if you want to make sure that the speed of your app is consistent. In theory, requestAnimationFrame() may work in 1 millisecond or even a few seconds. You never know, because it depends on the hardware being ready. In practice it's quite consistent, but if you're ever about to make a JavaScript game, you'd probably want to use DateTime to check how much time actually passed between frames. In other words, assuming that 1 frame = 1 logic cycle is usually wrong.
