You will build your first Svelte app that uses multiple routes, handles forms and consumes a full CRUD API.\n\nSvelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. It is a framework that really isn't a framework. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Full Code: https://github.com/hidjou/classsed-svelte-tutorial\n\ud83d\udd17 API Base URL: https://ndb99xkpdk.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev\n\ud83d\udd17 Rich Harris talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created by Classsed.

I read about this stuff all the time, including frameworks.  I don't use React or Vue, but do think about learning one from time to time.  I have considered learning Typescript ... but then realized what I like about JavaScript is skipping the compiling step.  But now I'm interested in Svelte .... because it seems like a lot less writing code.  One thing I really do not understand.  Svelte web site states it does not yet support Typescript, but has plans to do so.  This really perplexes me.   They both have compilers ... why would someone that programs in Typescript want to use the Svelte compiler ... why not just stick with the Typescript compiler?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "M W Sloat", "text": "@Kitty Medusa Thanks for the reply.
