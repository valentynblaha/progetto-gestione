You will build your first Svelte app that uses multiple routes, handles forms and consumes a full CRUD API.\n\nSvelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. It is a framework that really isn't a framework. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Full Code: https://github.com/hidjou/classsed-svelte-tutorial\n\ud83d\udd17 API Base URL: https://ndb99xkpdk.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev\n\ud83d\udd17 Rich Harris talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created by Classsed.
