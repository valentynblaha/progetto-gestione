I have a question please.... love the coverage on this type material and i thought i heard you say most commands here are not new and they are covered in 9 other videos if we have been thru them.... I have searched for other videos related to this one.. and cannot find them..\nI even looked on your site Python Basics.. and with 600 videos there i will never find the 9... but very interested in finding the other related videos like Panda etc and others that would help me follow this lesson.... Can you shed any light on the 9 videos you referred to or did i misunderstand what you said.. but keep up the great work.... love your videos.... but did notice the volume level on the videos is very low. I am old with bad hearing and i can make them out ok but would be even better if the volume lever was more like what is here on freecodecamp... I have to turn it down here...
