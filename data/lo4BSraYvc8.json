There are tons of languages with their own pros and cons and use cases. Programming is mostly about problem solving.

If you like it, I suggest you stick to it.\n2) You can learn through self-study, and you can learn by taking classes and boot-camps. If you can afford it, I suggest you pick the latter. But if you pick the former, you need to be consistent, practice, solve problems and do mini-projects while you're learning.\n3) I started with c++, I've been using c++ and Qt to make desktop applications.

I have some books teaching me exactly how to right particular programs . There are a few problems with that I am not sure exactly what is in that library however I guess I could probably just go into that library and see what is in it . One of the books that I have teaches pygame zero and another book teaches tkinter and yet another book teaches the main library  . My learning disability makes learning programming way difficult and with no real support group I am on my own as far as learning goes . I have talked to people about programming before and they are usually nice about sharing information but it is usually incomplete information or they do not want to talk about it at all or their attitude is that they are not going to hold your hand through the whole learning process but things like this take hard work so I am just going to put it more effort . could you explain to me the difference between programming and object oriented programming . If I am correct any app that you write is going to use object oriented programming and I guess business is done in regular programming and if that is the case why would you write it in computer code and not just write it down ?
