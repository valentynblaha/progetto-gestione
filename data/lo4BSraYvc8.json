If you like it, I suggest you stick to it.\n2) You can learn through self-study, and you can learn by taking classes and boot-camps. If you can afford it, I suggest you pick the latter. But if you pick the former, you need to be consistent, practice, solve problems and do mini-projects while you're learning.\n3) I started with c++, I've been using c++ and Qt to make desktop applications.
