In this case, it is talking about the variable \"index\", which judging by the [0] after it, is likely being recognized as an array (think of it as a list of values that the computers indexes (or counts), and can look for. The \"[0]\" says \"Item in the array in position 0\". Confusing at first, but keep in mind that computers start counting from 0, not 1 like we humans do. SO that translates to \"item at the beginning of the list\". Finally,  the last bit, \"out of bounds for length 0\" is pretty straightforward: the item cannot be referenced because  it doesn't exits. Basically, its saying \"I can't find the item at the beginning of the list because I have nothing in that list to look at.\"\n\n\nHope that helps.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Antonio Siqueira", "text": "TKS.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rachid", "text": "Thank you !", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "hitec16", "text": "please use dark theme in the IDE. its easy on the eyes", "likes": 5}, "replies": [{"author": "Julien Reszka", "text": "You shouldn't stay in a dark room it's bad for your eyes.\nLight Theme is the best theme, it's adapted to good working conditions, with good lighting in the room.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "tarun kr 535", "text": "First 38 secons and I'm enjoying it...\nYou're funny man.
