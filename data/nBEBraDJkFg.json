It's good to keep that in mind, especially when you will have the numbers coming out of variables or functions. \n\nAnd great videos Beau, keep them coming!", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "J", "text": "Greats vids, could you make one about Higher order functions \"map, reduce,lift\".
