You dont't give correct and clear information. DI through constructor is not a feature of Nest but typescript. And it's not possible because the argument is preceded only by private. It's possible because private is an access modifier of Typescript and the feature applies to all access modifiers. The way you explain it makes it painful to understand for those who wants to understand the underlying logic. I decided to leave the course at the 20th minute becasue I fear that soon I will face a new concept which I dont know at all and you will just give a superficial explanation.\n\nEdit: Anyway Ive completed the course. Still I think there is a lot to learn from it. Very happy to learn about Prisma and how to use it with Docker. Also its valuable that tests are covered in the course.\n\nLike I expected I faced another vague explanation for setting a @@map for prisma. The explanation was 'Because prisma likes it'.

However if you pause the video at 44:05 You'll see that in AuthService vsCode's code-completion actually imports the PrismaService directly from prisma/prisma.service.ts .. Yet the way we fix the error is by exporting our PrismaService from the PrismaModule .. Which is honestly just confusing .. If we are going to import and use the PrismaService directly from it's file, then what is the point of using this modular structure?
