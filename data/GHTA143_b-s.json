I see you defined Prisma module as global and then used it in every other one, but I see few issues here:\n1 - What if it's required to change the data access mechanism? All the business logic would be ruined. Of course it is more handy to use ORMs and do not cover them behind some DAO interface, but but but\n2 - Complex work with database can be dirty and all that dirt comes directly to service layer, which I found... you know, dirty)\n\nHow am I supposed to do that NestJs way?\nI mean I surely can define DAO layer myself in some folder, export singleton objects that will interact with data sources, but I wonder if there's a way to do that inside Nest architecture pattern?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxeZKU36GKrMUmgRR94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-09-16T15:07:56Z", "author": "slah Omar", "text": "what the name of the terminal used in the course", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzil68PvjWVPNTPMel4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-09-14T02:01:29Z", "author": "Aislan de Sousa Maia", "text": "Thanks for the awesome tutorial!!!!

It's possible because private is an access modifier of Typescript and the feature applies to all access modifiers. The way you explain it makes it painful to understand for those who wants to understand the underlying logic. I decided to leave the course at the 20th minute becasue I fear that soon I will face a new concept which I dont know at all and you will just give a superficial explanation.\n\nEdit: Anyway Ive completed the course.

I have one issue though with the (apparent) way Nest does modules/providers .. If you play the video from about minute 43:40 .. We want to use our Prisma service inside the Auth Service. You see we already have the PrismaService as a provider to the PrismaModule which we import into the AuthModule... However if you pause the video at 44:05 You'll see that in AuthService vsCode's code-completion actually imports the PrismaService directly from prisma/prisma.service.ts .. Yet the way we fix the error is by exporting our PrismaService from the PrismaModule .. Which is honestly just confusing .. If we are going to import and use the PrismaService directly from it's file, then what is the point of using this modular structure? The only way this might be explained is if vsCode is doing the auto-import, but it is not actually being used, that in fact the AuthModule itself is being used to provide the PrismaService to the AuthService at compile/runtime .. \nHopefully someone else noticed this..", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxrUYkBMTOCVVirfR54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-03T13:56:07Z", "author": "Ghost kee", "text": "this should be a nestJs Course for Beginners, you just made it complex by focusing more on Prisma and other things.", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxxzhXai4ev-wQIXaF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-02T20:05:54Z", "author": "Josh Howard", "text": "Tutorial breaks a little for mac m1 users when it gets to the argon stuff.
