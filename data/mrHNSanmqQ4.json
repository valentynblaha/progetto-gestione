By default nodemon watches the main js file which is \"index.js\". It knows that \"index.js\" is your main file because it is listed as such in package.json which was created by default behaviour of npm init command we used at the start. So if you use just \"nodemon\" command it will run the app watching index.js file. You can add additional js and json files to be watched for changes by nodemon and since we work with server.js file we use \"nodemon server\" command. Now nodemon watches index.js and server.js for changes.
