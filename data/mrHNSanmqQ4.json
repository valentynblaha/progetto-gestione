And for the front end I don't understand why you'd go for a react boilerplate wich is harder to work with and seriously not better, not easier and not as elegant as angular or even vue, making a workable framework out of React ecosystem for larger applications is another challenge you can choose to not impose to yourself... And database wise, well, if it is small one it can be encapsuled in your back end deliverable and if not you are probably better going for something more enginnered or with more services if it is cloud based...
