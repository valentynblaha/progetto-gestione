As opposed to no paramater. Then, we would not have to account for checking when cart is updated.. right? \n\nAlso, something more important. I am trying to wrap my head around why we must specify the cart variable in the dependency array. What I would like to point out (and hopefully shed some light for others on something I had it a bit more difficult to grasp) but please anyone correct me if I am wrong, is that: one should see the callback that John wraps with the useCallback call as a CLOSURE. That is, a function that has some state to it. Basically, when that function is created, its so-called \u201cstate\u201d is going to be the value of the \u201ccart\u201d variable at that specific moment of creation. Then, whenever you would call that function( / \u201ccallback\u201d ), it would simply get that initial value of the cart variable and increment it. Let\u2019s say we call it again; then again, get the INITIAL value of cart (stored in the state of the function, as I said) and increment it. Basically, that function alone only keeps incrementing the same value over and over again. (Or am I wrong and this is not what happens, because useState takes care of incrementing the actual value of the cart variable - and by \u201cactual\u201d I mean \u201ccurrent\u201d?)

Because I supposed that there would be a  resize event listener as a residual of Item Component. In the previous example of cleanup function in this video, cleanup function is called right before callback function of useEffect is called and right after render is finished. But in Show/Hide Component example, there was no re-rendering for Component Item when Show/Hide button is clicked to hide it. So callback of useEffect is not called again and this made me think that one event Listener remains after Item.

Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.\n  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.\n  3. Remove \"eslint\" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.\n  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.\n\nIn most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.\nIf this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:\n\n  5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.\n     This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.\n\n  6. Check if /Users/owner/node_modules/eslint is outside your project directory.\n     For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.\n\n  7. Try running npm ls eslint in your project folder.\n     This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed eslint.\n\nIf nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.\nThat would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.\n\nP.S. We know this message is long but please read the steps above :-) We hope you find them helpful!\n\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\nnpm ERR! errno 1\nnpm ERR! tutorial@0.1.0 start: `react-scripts start`\nnpm ERR!
