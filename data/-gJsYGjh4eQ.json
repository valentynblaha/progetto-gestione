Worse yet, the mischievous Mallory delights in changing messages sent between parties. \n\nIn such a hostile environment how can Alice talk to Bob without their messages being overheard and how can she be sure that it was Bob that sent the message in the first place? \n\nThis talk will take a brief look at historic codes and ciphers before taking a look at modern day Cryptography. If you want to be able to know the difference between a block cipher and a stream cipher or get a glimpse into the mathematics behind public key Cryptography this talk is for you.\n\nTalk given by Chris Riley at PHP UK Conference 2018.\n\nThe talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk but we are excited to share it with a wider audience.\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT55M27S", "likes": "197", "views": "7082"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mohammed Raissouni", "text": "Hello I want to start learning cryptography but i don't know how to start ?
