It gives the manual of a command. First try _man man_.\n\nDIRECTORIES\n\n1:01:26 _ls -a_\n   The command _ls -a_ shows all the files whether they're hidden or don't. Hide a file by naming it with a period at the start (ex: .gitignore). \n1:10:55 _mkdir -p Grandfather/father/child_\n  Make a child folder within a parent or secuence of parent folders one inside the other even if these don't exist.\n1:14:57 _rmdir -p Grandfather/father/child_\n  If there are more than one empty child folder, the parent folder isn't deleted. If you want to delete a folder and all its content, use this: _rm -rf directory_name_\n1:16:56 Everything in Linus OS is a file. Directories are considered special files.\n\nFILES\n\n1:22:02 _touch file1 file2 file3_\n  Create multiple files.\n1:25:25 _rm -rf directory_\n  Remove a non-empty directory. The options -r (recursive) and -f (force) will recursively force the deleting the folders and files inside.\n1:31:06 _mv_\n  The common use is just move a file to other directory: _mv file /other/directory_\n  But many people use this command to rename files: _mv file file_renamed_\n  You can also rename and move a file all at once: _mv file /other/directory/file_renamed_\n  The absolute path is needed, so you can use ~ to avoid the _/home/username_ part of the path.\n1:40:17 _cat file1 file2 file3 > output_file_\n  You can can concatenate several files and print it to the console _(cat file1 file2 file3)_ or print it to another file (a new one is created if doesn't exist), like the complete command above.\n  You can also omit the files and just create a new one that then you must to fill on terminal (Ctrl+D to finish): _cat > new_file_\n  A similar way to create (if doesn't exist) and fill a file on terminal is with _echo_ command: _echo strings... > new_file_\n\nYou can reference a file by its exact name, and it matches just one file, but you can also reference multiple files by a regular expresion (a expresion with special characters like *). For example, you can delete all text files in a directory with this command: _rm *.txt_\n\nFILE STRUCTURE\n\n1:56:53 _lib/_\n  It's like _Program files_ on Windows: a  folder that contains all that's needed to run a program.\n1:59:02 _root/_\n  It's the home of the root account.\n2:02:12 _usr/_\n  Stores files and utilities that are shared between users.\n2:02:28 _var/_\nIt's where variable data is stored, usually system logs.\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\n\n2:06:32 _free -h_\n  Shows the use of memory, and the option _-h_ is to make it human-readable.\n2:08_06 _ps -A_\n  Shows a snapshot of all proccess, all with a unique ID. The you can kill a proccess by tha command _kill <proccessID>_\n\nNETWORKING\n\n2:18:50 _ip_\n  The newest version of the _ifconfig_ command.\n\nPACKAGE MANAGER\n\n2:20:45 _sudo_\n  Stands for _super user do._ It's used to access to restricted files and operations.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx1zKXAMy74c6M794J4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-19T11:31:41Z", "author": "ANKIT PATEL", "text": "Bhosdike enter ko inner kyu bol rha h", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwtMH3_hFuOlfwm49V4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-19T11:00:56Z", "author": "Halo Hat", "text": "I don't know why, for some reason your instruction is sticking with me.

However, if you want to go deep into how your computer works or if you're interested in higher level IT jobs, knowing your way around a command line is invaluable. \n\nAs an example, let's say you want to create 20 folders. With the graphical interface, you right click an empty part of your desktop, and create a new folder. Pretty easy. However, you will quickly realize that doing that 19 more times is very tedious. With the command line, you can write out a script that will create 20 folders at once. I don't have a particular script to show you, but it can be done that way. It is tedious and does take a long time and practice to get good at it. However, if you do become proficient in the command line, you'll find that certain tasks are very quickly achieved through there rather than the graphical interface.", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzu6BchaPgAsRKb5-h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-10T21:53:53Z", "author": "GODSEN", "text": "Wow!
