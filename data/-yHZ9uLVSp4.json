Introducing new features in the prod is dangerous, so you want that feature deployed (feature code) in the prod, but you don't want it visible or usable in the prod.\n\n Example: you have a hotel booking app. Currently, there are 2 modes of payments available that your app users can use to book hotels viz. Debit card and Credit Card. Your company management decides to give users one more option: Digital Wallet to make payments. So, essentially this is a new feature for your app. You need to write the code for this. Obviously, your QA and other teams will do the testing and all before getting this new feature(payment mode) shipped to prod. Still, in prod, conditions are always a  bit different. So, in prod, you don't want every user to view this feature because if its\u2019 not stable it'll ruin the overall experience for users. You might decide to enable to feature location (city) wise. So, first you want this new payment mode (feature) to be available for users in Delhi. Then, after 2 months of continuous use if everything works (feature/new payment mode is stable) then you want to roll the same out to users in other cities.  This is something you can accomplish by using feature flags.\n\nThis is just one typical use case. There are a lot of use cases where feature flags are like godsend.\n\nSo, the thing is from app code (source code) point of view, the code you\u2019ll write for new feature (digital wallet payment mode) will be wrapped within some condition, so that, it remains unavailable for use in prod even if the app containing that code is deployed. So, to make it available you need make the condition that wrapped the feature code true. This is what is called toggling/switching(feature toggle/switch). There are multiple ways to do this. This basically depends on how you have implemented feature flags. You can use  toggle manually (but not many orgs do this). Or you can use some feature flag service like Launch Darkly. Launch Darkly got its name from the concept \u201cDark Lauch\u201d. Dark Launch is possible only because of feature flags. As the name suggest, you are launching a feature in a dark mode (its not visible to all users. You can even make it completely invisible to all users).", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyKZZiFsfGRK36xj054AaABAg.9V5OnLMZz269Xz_mFIVhSX", "publishedAt": "2022-02-03T13:28:10Z", "author": "Hafidz Rahman", "text": "Sometimes u need to turn off new features in production when something happens on the run, that's the function", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyKZZiFsfGRK36xj054AaABAg.9V5OnLMZz269V7N2_SAdXW", "publishedAt": "2021-11-24T09:47:11Z", "author": "D Israel", "text": "@Youssef Khedher still sucks explanation, can u try eli5 it", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyKZZiFsfGRK36xj054AaABAg.9V5OnLMZz269V5ii6Sck13", "publishedAt": "2021-11-23T18:26:45Z", "author": "Youssef Khedher", "text": "watch this section 0:14:36", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyKZZiFsfGRK36xj054AaABAg.9V5OnLMZz269V5WifQEc8P", "publishedAt": "2021-11-23T16:33:13Z", "author": "D Israel", "text": "Same , intro sucks as wel", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxSRMkrFFUtOZWKAs94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-23T15:22:11Z", "author": "Rahul Choudhary", "text": "Awesome!
