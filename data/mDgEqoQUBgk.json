This project uses React (custom hooks, useContext, useState, useEffect, useRef), Firebase (Firestore/auth), Tailwind CSS, LoadTest, Lighthouse, Vercel, React Testing Library and Cypress E2E Testing.\n\nThis React project has multiple pages: login, sign up, dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos), and user profiles. The sign-in page connects to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, Firebase auth is used to store the user in the Firebase auth database. After the application is built you will learn how to deploy it to Vercel.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Karl Hadwen.
