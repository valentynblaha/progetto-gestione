It provides background information on how NumPy works and how it compares to Python's Built-in lists. This video goes through how to write code with NumPy. It starts with the basics of creating arrays and then gets into more advanced stuff. The video covers creating arrays, indexing, math, statistics, reshaping, and more.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Code: https://github.com/KeithGalli/NumPy\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Tutorial from Keith Galli.
