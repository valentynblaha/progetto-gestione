For example, if your input value is a scalar age:\n\nage = 27\r\ninput_tensor = tf.reshape(age, (1,))\r\n\nAlternatively, you may have inadvertently passed a scalar value as input to a model that expects a vector.

I've been watching a few other TensorFlow tutorials, and one thing I learned is that when you rerun the model.fit() method without completely redefining the model from step 0, you're actually just continuing the training from where you left off.  In other words, when he drops the epochs to 8, he's not training a new network with fewer epochs, he's training the same network he just trained _again,_ with 8 additional epochs.  You can actually see this in the output: the first epoch in the 10 epoch run has an accuracy of 0.8269, but the first epoch in the 8 epoch run starts above 0.9, as does the single epoch run.

For example, lets say you have a dataset that consists of a number of points that are fairly close together, but a few that are quite far away (of course, they would have to be close enough to not be outlier data).

Also, I don't think you collapsed the 3 channels of RGB into a single channel of Gray, so cmap on RGB has no effect. I believe the colors are darker, because the new image RGB channels are now between [-1.0, 1.0] (float), and plt.imgshow() has considered all negative numbers as 0, effectively making the image [0.0, 1.0] (float) and multiplied each number by 255.

I am currently at 2:03:08 and so far I have noticed two main things:\n\nat 1:11:05 he explained that in linear regression in 3d space, assuming a linear relationship, you try to use two variables to predict the value of the third. This is true, but the model is then not a straight line pointing somewhere in 3d space, but a 2d plane. Such false information gives beginners a bad intuition for these things. \n\nFurthermore, the whole Titanic survival prediction section was a classification task, so it had little to do with linear regression. He used the LinearClassifier object, which (probably) runs a logistic regression in the background. In the output dictionary, there were keys that are typical for the output of a logistic regression. Although linear regression and logistic regression are both algorithms that create models that assume a linear relationship between input variables, they are completely different algorithms. I would have liked to see a clear distinction between regression and classification problems here, because these are fundamental concepts in ML and the video wrongly conveys that you solve a regression problem by predicting whether a passenger survives or not.\n\nedit: His intuitive explanation at 3:09:13 of what activation functions do is just wrong. The sigmoid function does not project the data points into higher dimensional space, quite the opposite, actually. The sigmoid function is defined as f: R^n -> [0,1], so it takes as input an n-dimensional vector and it yields a scalar (fancy word for a single number). This whole \"projection into higher dimensional space\" thing is known as the Kernel trick and is NOT used in his examples, it's something completely different. Activation functions are used in Neural Networks because they introduce non-linearity which you need because otherwise your Neural Network would just be a linear classifier so it would basically do one big weighted summation of the inputs. This is not enough to capture complicated relationships in data. With non-linearity introduced, it can be shown that a Neural Network can approximate any function with arbitrary accuracy, that is any function that might have generated the data. Read up on the universal approximation theorem, if you want to learn more.\n\nedit 2: 3:36:15 You don't evaluate on your test data multiple times to select the best set of hyperparameters. That way, you overfit your test data. A cleaner approach would be to split the data into three sets: the training set, the validation set and the test set. Prior to training you define a few selections of hyperparameters you want to select the best from before you train all these models on the training data. You then evaluate the performance of each model on the validation data. Finally, you select the best performing model and test it on the test data to get a final estimate of the model's performance on completely new data points. There are more sophisticated approaches to do hyperparameter tuning but this is the basic idea.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzooToPjoEY-v1DIeJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-03T09:41:52Z", "author": "vsigal", "text": "Better to use :print(tf.__version__)  , not   print(tf.version)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyuewJQgUB7UppWjbF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-03T09:24:41Z", "author": "Schoenling Wunderbar", "text": "4:47:18 Worst example ever", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzfW_KSV0cgx_SLn_F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-02T12:58:48Z", "author": "Schoenling Wunderbar", "text": "3:12:10 Presenter is repeatedly unprepared, this time is quite bad and makes it hard to follow the course", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugycj1NKskLf2dQNwWV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-02T10:32:45Z", "author": "Schoenling Wunderbar", "text": "1:43:32 I was actually hoping to hear an explanation for the need of an input function and not just a remark to read the documentation", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyD657gy8W163lrgql4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-01T07:39:59Z", "author": "Yashsvi Dixit", "text": "People : why no holistic courses on YouTube\nTim : _Hold my Perceptron_", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxCpJDPtMU0_jbWgsB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-27T15:10:40Z", "author": "Eman Shlkamy", "text": "how to use the Senticnet ? and what is the benefits of using it  plz", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy7Uwpg5QCKCwZpsjx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-27T11:42:41Z", "author": "tyrone van den berg", "text": "_future_ : module name not found (PLEASE_UPDATE) @Tech_With_Tim", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzcICnDbt79yswudgl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-25T03:03:59Z", "author": "vasu gupta", "text": "Just wanted to point out that linear regression model example is actually a classification example as you are classifying survival or death.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyXSJqvLulny3mob694AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-24T13:12:22Z", "author": "MOHAMMEDSOHIL SHAIKH", "text": "This guy is always been one of my favorits.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxbSErdepA84WcQF0R4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-23T08:14:40Z", "author": "Mohit Kumar", "text": "44:00", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy4q5JDHKvWtFRgGXV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-22T19:59:11Z", "author": "Some Dude", "text": "Put it in 1.25 speed so you finish it faster", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz9IoXIQe21NsH339h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-22T02:32:24Z", "author": "Nicholas Bailey", "text": "great job man!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwJytjbVE68KVJ3zQB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-20T22:40:28Z", "author": "Lin Cheng", "text": "4:31:00 Can someone explain to me where the number 32 comes from?

It should be kept in mind that neurons in a layers shouldn't be too much otherwise you will need large training data, or too less like in the order [784, 5, 10] as this will result in loss of information.\n2. For intermediate layers ReLU works for most of the tasks, however \"tanh\" also works well.\n3. For last layer the activation should be sigmoid if it is a binary classification problem (Your output neuron is 1). For multi-class classification, it should be softmax.\n4. Loss function: for binary classification = binary_crossentropy, for classifying n-categories = categorical_crossentropy, for classifying n-categories but the output is one-hot encoded = sparse_categorical_crossentropy, or mean squared error for other tasks. \n5.

In the financial time series forecasting ML sphere I've only met one guy (Tom Starke) who has said anything rational. Everyone else is more or less Siraj.

I haven't seen anyone build better ML models than the hand tuned hands-on real time manual adjustment algorithms I've built. I only need ML as icing on the cake to extract any last edge, and nobody seems to understand the basic principles of building a predictive model. For example none of the tutorials explain one-shot methods. That means everything out there overfits and it worse than useless!
