I've been watching a few other TensorFlow tutorials, and one thing I learned is that when you rerun the model.fit() method without completely redefining the model from step 0, you're actually just continuing the training from where you left off.  In other words, when he drops the epochs to 8, he's not training a new network with fewer epochs, he's training the same network he just trained _again,_ with 8 additional epochs.  You can actually see this in the output: the first epoch in the 10 epoch run has an accuracy of 0.8269, but the first epoch in the 8 epoch run starts above 0.9, as does the single epoch run.  By the end, the model has effectively gone through 19 epochs.\n\nTl;dr: he's not actually reducing the number of epochs like he thinks he his.

I'm fairly certain actual algorithms don't care about splitting the points evenly, they just look for the line that minimizes the sum of the distances to each point.  Sometimes that splits them evenly, but not always.  For example, lets say you have a dataset that consists of a number of points that are fairly close together, but a few that are quite far away (of course, they would have to be close enough to not be outlier data).  The line of best fit would try to minimize the distance to _all_ points, including the few farther ones, and that might not necessarily split the data points evenly.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nehoray Melamed", "text": "Thanks!!\nIs there any summary of that video?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bapho Boye", "text": "Bro really did cover all the topics.

This is most likely a requirement of the MobileNet model that is being used as a base later on, it has been trained on input within this scale. Also, I don't think you collapsed the 3 channels of RGB into a single channel of Gray, so cmap on RGB has no effect. I believe the colors are darker, because the new image RGB channels are now between [-1.0, 1.0] (float), and plt.imgshow() has considered all negative numbers as 0, effectively making the image [0.0, 1.0] (float) and multiplied each number by 255. Efffectively, all pixels that originally had low RGB values became black, and the ones that had high RGB values (were brighter), got collapsed to between [0, 127], i.e. became darker.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "NIKLAS DAMM", "text": "22.9.22  19:00", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rafa\u0142 Wr\u00f3blewski", "text": "2:24:00", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Adrian Gray", "text": "Thank you very much for the cluster algorithm explanation, is very useful in multiple cases.\nAlso watched the whole tutorial in one watch \ud83d\udc4d\nBtw, there are a lot of \"impostor\" tutorials on youtube, where people \"teach\" without knowing what are they talking about, sadly people watch these and also buy their \"curses\" or even do online \"training\" ending up not understanding a thing.\n\nOne thing that I can say about the tut, is that would've been nice if you've touched a bit more about the backpropagation process how the weights are updated, and also how the descent/optimization might not always get to the lowest minimum (you had the arrows drawn actually in the example but probably forgot to explain them?) and get stucked in a local minimum", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "JAI", "text": "3:55:54", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Libby Lebyane", "text": "On module 3, why is the eval dataframe not shuffled?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Hashim Al-jifri", "text": "Splendid!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ali Ahmed", "text": "Thank you Tim!\nIt was a remarkable introductory course \ud83d\ude0a", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "\u207a \u2460\u2465\u24ea\u2460\u2468\u2467\u24ea\u2460\u2465\u2460\u2463 WhatsApp ", "text": "Helpline\ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udce5\u2b06\ufe0f\nQuestions can come in\u2b06\ufe0f\u2026.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Yang Yang", "text": "is tf another google+ now?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "\u207a \u2460\u2465\u24ea\u2460\u2468\u2467\u24ea\u2460\u2465\u2460\u2463 WhatsApp ", "text": "Helpline\ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udce5\u2b06\ufe0f\nQuestions can come in\u2b06\ufe0f\u2026.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Babak Ojaroudi", "text": "Thanks for this perfect course, I really enjoyed this tutorial, Ty Tim", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "\u207a \u2460\u2465\u24ea\u2460\u2468\u2467\u24ea\u2460\u2465\u2460\u2463 WhatsApp ", "text": "Helpline\ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udce5\u2b06\ufe0f\nQuestions can come in\u2b06\ufe0f\u2026.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pablo Ruiz", "text": "Amazing effort, thank you so much for the video!

I am currently at 2:03:08 and so far I have noticed two main things:\n\nat 1:11:05 he explained that in linear regression in 3d space, assuming a linear relationship, you try to use two variables to predict the value of the third. This is true, but the model is then not a straight line pointing somewhere in 3d space, but a 2d plane. Such false information gives beginners a bad intuition for these things. \n\nFurthermore, the whole Titanic survival prediction section was a classification task, so it had little to do with linear regression. He used the LinearClassifier object, which (probably) runs a logistic regression in the background. In the output dictionary, there were keys that are typical for the output of a logistic regression. Although linear regression and logistic regression are both algorithms that create models that assume a linear relationship between input variables, they are completely different algorithms. I would have liked to see a clear distinction between regression and classification problems here, because these are fundamental concepts in ML and the video wrongly conveys that you solve a regression problem by predicting whether a passenger survives or not.\n\nedit: His intuitive explanation at 3:09:13 of what activation functions do is just wrong. The sigmoid function does not project the data points into higher dimensional space, quite the opposite, actually. The sigmoid function is defined as f: R^n -> [0,1], so it takes as input an n-dimensional vector and it yields a scalar (fancy word for a single number). This whole \"projection into higher dimensional space\" thing is known as the Kernel trick and is NOT used in his examples, it's something completely different. Activation functions are used in Neural Networks because they introduce non-linearity which you need because otherwise your Neural Network would just be a linear classifier so it would basically do one big weighted summation of the inputs. This is not enough to capture complicated relationships in data. With non-linearity introduced, it can be shown that a Neural Network can approximate any function with arbitrary accuracy, that is any function that might have generated the data. Read up on the universal approximation theorem, if you want to learn more.\n\nedit 2: 3:36:15 You don't evaluate on your test data multiple times to select the best set of hyperparameters. That way, you overfit your test data. A cleaner approach would be to split the data into three sets: the training set, the validation set and the test set. Prior to training you define a few selections of hyperparameters you want to select the best from before you train all these models on the training data. You then evaluate the performance of each model on the validation data. Finally, you select the best performing model and test it on the test data to get a final estimate of the model's performance on completely new data points. There are more sophisticated approaches to do hyperparameter tuning but this is the basic idea.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "vsigal", "text": "Better to use :print(tf.__version__)  , not   print(tf.version)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Schoenling Wunderbar", "text": "4:47:18 Worst example ever", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ujjawal Saini", "text": "He looks like Saitama", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Schoenling Wunderbar", "text": "3:12:10 Presenter is repeatedly unprepared, this time is quite bad and makes it hard to follow the course", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Schoenling Wunderbar", "text": "1:43:32 I was actually hoping to hear an explanation for the need of an input function and not just a remark to read the documentation", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Yashsvi Dixit", "text": "People : why no holistic courses on YouTube\nTim : _Hold my Perceptron_", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Eman Shlkamy", "text": "how to use the Senticnet ? and what is the benefits of using it  plz", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "tyrone van den berg", "text": "_future_ : module name not found (PLEASE_UPDATE) @Tech_With_Tim", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "vasu gupta", "text": "Just wanted to point out that linear regression model example is actually a classification example as you are classifying survival or death.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "MOHAMMEDSOHIL SHAIKH", "text": "This guy is always been one of my favorits.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mohit Kumar", "text": "44:00", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Some Dude", "text": "Put it in 1.25 speed so you finish it faster", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nicholas Bailey", "text": "great job man!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Lin Cheng", "text": "4:31:00 Can someone explain to me where the number 32 comes from?

But there are somethings that need to be considered when training your network:\n1.Your main goal is to prevent over-fitting, therefore you moniter metrics like accuracy and keep on changing the intermediate layers only. It should be kept in mind that neurons in a layers shouldn't be too much otherwise you will need large training data, or too less like in the order [784, 5, 10] as this will result in loss of information.\n2. For intermediate layers ReLU works for most of the tasks, however \"tanh\" also works well.\n3. For last layer the activation should be sigmoid if it is a binary classification problem (Your output neuron is 1). For multi-class classification, it should be softmax.\n4. Loss function: for binary classification = binary_crossentropy, for classifying n-categories = categorical_crossentropy, for classifying n-categories but the output is one-hot encoded = sparse_categorical_crossentropy, or mean squared error for other tasks. \n5.
