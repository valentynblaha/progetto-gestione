I will not work overtime for less then what I make an hour period, I think all would agree. )- Mistake comment......... explanation below...... \n\nWhen I am wrong I Amit it.\n\n I do believe I was wrong and I miss spoke. You total the hours of pay and then you added ( the half of pay to it Times the total number of Overtime hours )..... Too me the way you explained it was confusing since I do not calculate it that way..... it took me a few times of watching the video to find out I was wrong.\n\nSidenote\nBy watching your video I understand if statement now for the most part and wrote one. That does just that calculates up to 40 hours and returns 0 or - if no hours of overtimes is there.   ( less confusing for me that way ).\n\nI do believe, correct me if I am wrong... overtime pay is Time and 1/2 .............\n\n(Time) = Your rate of pay and hour              \n(and) =                        +\n(1/2) =    Half your rate of pay hour\n\n      This really applies to lets say \" Holiday pay\" which when you work on a holiday... which also equals to Time and 1/2 like overtime pay. If you are one of the lucky ones that gets the day off but get paid for it then it is just your \" Regular rate of pay an hour \"\n\nSee examples below....... ( at lease this is how I do the calculation )\n\nLets say a person make $15.00 a hour ( 40 hours work week is assumed ) and 4 hours overtime\n\n15.00/2= $7.50   1/2 your rate of pay\n15.00+7.50= $22.50  Overtime payment and hour\n\n15.00*40= $600.00   Regular Rate of pay total\n22.50*4= $90.00  Overtime Rate of pay total\n\n600+90= $690.00  Total of Reg and Overtime together\n\nside note\nDouble time is your pay doubled, so if you get $15.00 hour, your pay would be $30.00 an hour.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Caveman Hood", "text": "Still watching, other then the glitch I listed above I found it informative\n\n1:38:00ish their you said or said something along the line of \" somebody and there stupidity \"  something close to that.... everyone make mistakes and I know I make more then my fair share of them...

As Susan has three possible stories to shop from, I fully expected you to first determine which store would provide her the best price for each item before calculating total cost. Why would she need three lists of costs and three totals? Is she only planning to go to one store? Or is she going to go to all 3 stores and only buy the items at their lowest cost? And, will she be picking up items for Tim as well? If she is, why isn't she combining the two lists of item quantities needed before figuring costs? If Tim isn't going shopping, why do we need his total at all? Why not make this a real real world experience? Also, I'm surprised that you didn't use $F3 to figure the item cost for each store so that you didn't have to write a new formula in H3 and I3.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "scoobydoo316us", "text": "When I did PIVOT TABLE mine still had everything.

If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\" (John. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior.

I have learned a lot about excel in the past couple of years, but I am mostly a novice as I do not build new spreadsheets often. I use a spreadsheet that I mostly built for work, where I input data along with a date that the data was input on. I have coded the formulas needed to give me a collective set of info we use each job site. \n   However, we also use the date info to guesstimate job site finish date and time as we go. To do this, we literally count the amount of data input by day and average it by hand. \n   I want to make a separate tab attached to this spreadsheet that automatically creates either a graph, or a table that will input the date by itself and *count* the number of dates that are put into the sheet on the main tab.\n  For example, if the job I'm on lasts 3 weeks and I input data on 12/2/21 14 times, and 12/3/21 13 times, etc the other tab should \"build\" a list table-style, or a graph that simply shows the number of entries by date and also averages it. I can do the average part, and I have read about getting into from another tab, and even how to reference the other tab by using the '!' function but collectively I cannot figure it all out.
