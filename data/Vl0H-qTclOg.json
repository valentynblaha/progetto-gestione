Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Ephesians. 2:8-9). \r\n\r\nThe ABCs of salvation by JDFarag.org \u2764\r\n\r\nAdmit that you are a sinner in need of a saviour. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:10 KJV 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:23 KJV 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\r\n\r\nB- Believe that Jesus is Lord, died for your sins and rose from the dead. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 5:8 KJV 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 6:23 KJV 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nC- Call upon his name. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:9 KJV 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:13 KJV 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwW5AVU00Q_4tz2spx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-15T11:48:01Z", "author": "Lada Rabonova", "text": "It just struck me, can anyone please explain to me how in the US an employee is paid every 5 weeks?

You total the hours of pay and then you added ( the half of pay to it Times the total number of Overtime hours )..... Too me the way you explained it was confusing since I do not calculate it that way..... it took me a few times of watching the video to find out I was wrong.\n\nSidenote\nBy watching your video I understand if statement now for the most part and wrote one. That does just that calculates up to 40 hours and returns 0 or - if no hours of overtimes is there.   ( less confusing for me that way ).\n\nI do believe, correct me if I am wrong... overtime pay is Time and 1/2 .............\n\n(Time) = Your rate of pay and hour              \n(and) =                        +\n(1/2) =    Half your rate of pay hour\n\n      This really applies to lets say \" Holiday pay\" which when you work on a holiday... which also equals to Time and 1/2 like overtime pay. If you are one of the lucky ones that gets the day off but get paid for it then it is just your \" Regular rate of pay an hour \"\n\nSee examples below....... ( at lease this is how I do the calculation )\n\nLets say a person make $15.00 a hour ( 40 hours work week is assumed ) and 4 hours overtime\n\n15.00/2= $7.50   1/2 your rate of pay\n15.00+7.50= $22.50  Overtime payment and hour\n\n15.00*40= $600.00   Regular Rate of pay total\n22.50*4= $90.00  Overtime Rate of pay total\n\n600+90= $690.00  Total of Reg and Overtime together\n\nside note\nDouble time is your pay doubled, so if you get $15.00 hour, your pay would be $30.00 an hour.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugz9AEK49HbdWTeBgoN4AaABAg.9eGTgXipvfi9eGomHVlvdA", "publishedAt": "2022-08-03T15:05:20Z", "author": "Caveman Hood", "text": "Still watching, other then the glitch I listed above I found it informative\n\n1:38:00ish their you said or said something along the line of \" somebody and there stupidity \"  something close to that.... everyone make mistakes and I know I make more then my fair share of them...

Basically, you end up in Satan's, the creature who is decieving souls into going to his house, hell, which will be his permanent residence in a few years, where he wants to take millions of souls including yours!

Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\" (John. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Ephesians. 2:8-9). \r\n\r\nThe ABCs of salvation by JDFarag.org \u2764\r\n\r\nAdmit that you are a sinner in need of a saviour. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:10 KJV 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:23 KJV 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\r\n\r\nB- Believe that Jesus is Lord, died for your sins and rose from the dead. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 5:8 KJV 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 6:23 KJV 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nC- Call upon his name. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:9 KJV 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:13 KJV 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved\n\n\nGod loves you bro. don't commit suicide", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzmrAz-C9X9AoVAH9R4AaABAg.9ao6Of4wt-y9dk4ColSprv", "publishedAt": "2022-07-21T12:34:43Z", "author": "Firelord Zuko", "text": "Good luck with your promotion.", "likes": 2}, {"id": "UgzmrAz-C9X9AoVAH9R4AaABAg.9ao6Of4wt-y9d5pTWeRbaz", "publishedAt": "2022-07-05T12:08:20Z", "author": "Talleyrand", "text": "@Adele Green hey adele green are you single? im interested", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzmrAz-C9X9AoVAH9R4AaABAg.9ao6Of4wt-y9d3SuKU0sYI", "publishedAt": "2022-07-04T14:03:56Z", "author": "Adele Green", "text": "all the best for the future \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude0a", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwnBch1aL7q2OiCD194AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-08T12:51:35Z", "author": "H J", "text": "40:00 gradebook\n57:33 decision factors\n1:05:05 sales database\n1:23:21 car database\n1:57:45 problem solving", "likes": 14}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwnBch1aL7q2OiCD194AaABAg.9alZJ_73_g-9lpSH-YO900", "publishedAt": "2023-02-07T10:52:22Z", "author": "Wilda", "text": "Please How did you download the car inventory file?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwnBch1aL7q2OiCD194AaABAg.9alZJ_73_g-9l-TF3DHotr", "publishedAt": "2023-01-17T21:01:05Z", "author": "Loebarbie", "text": "1:21:13  please how did you download the sales file? \ud83d\ude4f", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwnBch1aL7q2OiCD194AaABAg.9alZJ_73_g-9gZA-dO-PCz", "publishedAt": "2022-09-29T11:08:39Z", "author": "Cheery Brighotaye", "text": "Please, I need the \"sales database\" data set in excel.

One day your heart will stop beating and you will be dead! The Bible says you\u2019ll then be judged by the holy and righteous God who created this universe.(Hebrew 9:27)You\u2019ll be judged for every word, thought, and action in your life.(Matthew 12:36-37) Will you be innocent or guilty?\n\n*Let\u2019s check the standard, the Ten Commandments.

If you\u2019ve lusted, you\u2019ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)\n\nIf you\u2019ve hated someone, the Bible says you\u2019re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you\u2019ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. God is perfect and He hates sin, but He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the Cross to take the punishment you deserve. Then He rose from the grave \u2013 defeating death.

And, will she be picking up items for Tim as well? If she is, why isn't she combining the two lists of item quantities needed before figuring costs? If Tim isn't going shopping, why do we need his total at all? Why not make this a real real world experience? Also, I'm surprised that you didn't use $F3 to figure the item cost for each store so that you didn't have to write a new formula in H3 and I3.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzfCtiOVHZitXH-nB94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-12T22:43:36Z", "author": "scoobydoo316us", "text": "When I did PIVOT TABLE mine still had everything.

If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\" (John. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Ephesians. 2:8-9). \r\n\r\nThe ABC's of salvation by JDFarag.org \u2764\r\n\r\nA-Admit that you are a sinner in need of a savior. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:10 KJV 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:23 KJV 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\r\n\r\nB- Believe that Jesus is Lord , died for your sins and rose from the dead. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 5:8 KJV 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 6:23 KJV 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nC- Call upon his name. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:9 KJV 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:13 KJV 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwxQyGtdXOHTnom3-t4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-03T18:37:11Z", "author": "SARIKA DATTA", "text": "Where can I download the sample data", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwO3zy4vTwsqDEjI114AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-03T16:10:51Z", "author": "Bahram Aghakhan", "text": "There's no way to thank you enough for this amazing tutorial video.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwO3zy4vTwsqDEjI114AaABAg.9Z6yeEteRNp9fHUw41TX8T", "publishedAt": "2022-08-28T17:53:48Z", "author": "chris falkenberg", "text": "Color of Money                                           State of Address                                       made in USA\r\n   Going around in circles ( circuits ), chasing after one another for the color of money, taking chances or welfare through inter-connecting passages , crossroads and Windows (MSN)  trying to control the animal in one, from the pit  of debt of desire, an emotions in the matrix.   $\r\n                                                                       Dollar    Dollar   Bills  \r\n Pressing the economics further, less than rich is most in debt, an the back bone of the rich, and the flesh and blood for the animal,   All in the name of what, property values.

The color of money makes people go wild (mad)  an adds to its fire.   Let me give it to you in other terms, terms you can understand.  They cut it like Bolvin coca, Afghani opium and Libyan oil, cut like silver and gold. Lords that have strings tied to the money, an every dollar in its web, hooking the foolish fish in the sea into its financial threshold.\r\n    Bending indexes, the color of money, dollars, dollar bills and currencies on a spectrum in a temple dimension, attracting interest .

Its a figment of your imagination that's running wild like a bull, a shift to red , so let me give you the 20/20, the whole 9/1/1 doppler tax free fix, in the city  that never sleeps.   Its supply and demand.  They build it up and take them down , and the penny is losing one for everyone made.  The nickel cant hold its weight , but its losing, an its face value is deceiving  the public eye, so save what you can .  \r\n  They cant afford it or  don't have it to give away, nor can they make  anymore,   Its coming from the blood that is spilling from the holes in ones pocket and clothing, and the bodies that are falling.

At the end of the sale,  and day , after all the hands have taken a pinch out of the dollar , dollar bill,  one is paying  with the bottom dollar, and by the time it gets home to its family, its taxed for the waste, so save what you can.  \r\n   Either way I, the self, put it , between the differences , it gives one the sum of the hole, the color of money  and  the same sum and truth ,the wholesumtruth.

Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Ephesians. 2:8-9). \r\n\r\nThe ABCs of salvation by JDFarag.org \u2764\r\n\r\nAdmit that you are a sinner in need of a saviour. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:10 KJV 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 3:23 KJV 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\r\n\r\nB- Believe that Jesus is Lord, died for your sins and rose from the dead. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 5:8 KJV 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 6:23 KJV 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\nC- Call upon his name. \r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:9 KJV 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\r\n\ud83d\udcd6Romans 10:13 KJV 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzhtfCrHNyi_ALewdR4AaABAg.9QnQcPU5Sbq9Y1FvlFAlpV", "publishedAt": "2022-02-04T14:23:41Z", "author": "Text  kincyber01 On Instagram \ud83d\udd25", "text": "he helped me get my sons page account unfreeze, his honest I can assure you in 20 minutes\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxoIT7mlDGSoGPy2314AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-08T06:54:02Z", "author": "Nam \u0110\u1ed7", "text": "nice tutor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx5AXFo-GviMjvsV6p4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-05T07:42:00Z", "author": "Triveni kokkili", "text": "49:40 - OR formula in excel", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwFpNwOb0vSjFU86Tt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-03T20:54:43Z", "author": "Judith Beechem", "text": "Can you calculate the deductions with this excel", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyJadEAsfVEwWlpN0Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-02T14:38:39Z", "author": "History Hub", "text": "Can anyone tell me how can you earn money by using excel?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgymerTHGTSKnlIFK9R4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-01T20:02:56Z", "author": "Uche", "text": "Does anyone have the worksheets?

The color of money makes people go wild  an adds to its fire.   Let me give it to you in other terms, terms you can understand.  They cut it like Bolvin coca, Afghani opium and Libyan oil, cut like silver and gold. Lords that have strings tied to the money, an every dollar in its web, hooking the foolish fish in the sea into its financial threshold.\r\n    Bending indexes, the color of money, dollars, dollar bills and currencies on a spectrum in a temple dimension, attracting interest .  A twenty/eighty cut is knot well/fare, it cuts like a knife, a double edge sword, it gives with one and takes with two, we want face value, the whole in one, par ,  one over one, knot promises or the color of money, that s blinding you.\r\n                                                      \" O say can you see,\"  ...   the twilight...                 \r\n Blind and color blind?

Its a figment of your imagination that's running wild like a bull, a shift to red , so let me give you the 20/20, the whole 9/1/1 doppler tax free fix, in the city  that never sleeps.   Its supply and demand.  They build it up and take them down , and the penny is losing one for everyone made.  The nickel cant hold its weight , but its losing, an its face value is deceiving  the public eye, so save what you can .  \r\n  They cant afford it or  don't have it to give away, nor can they make  anymore,   Its coming from the blood that is spilling from the holes in ones pocket and clothing, and the bodies that are falling.  Desire is working ten times harder for ten times less and buying things ten times over   exhausting its horns and pleasures.  At the end of the sale,  and day , after all the hands have taken a pinch out of the dollar , dollar bill,  one is paying  with the bottom dollar, and by the time it gets home to its family, its taxed for the waste, so save what you can.  \r\n   Either way I, the self, put it , between the differences , it gives one the sum of the hole, the color of money  and  the same sum and truth ,the wholesumtruth.   Now that the money can be made at home , it does not give one the right to cut it out of a  sheet of metal and stamp it with a dye,  or (DIO ?),  \" O, Alice, your the Greatest \", its de-facing the value . \" Its not what your  country can do for you , but what you can do for your country.\"    \" We the people\", put our trust in the government, ( each other), to provide honest scales and due process, but those who aren't themselves are favoring one side, one side of the scale, the dark side, even though the wind is not for sale, it gives one direction and shows the way , an only a fool doesn't pay attention to signs, lining its pockets , the holes in its clothing with the blood on its hands.  Those who live by it , live by the dollar , dollar bill , fall by it, and those who trust in it, give its power and right  over their lives, ( soul) .  \" O, say can you see\"\r\n    The only one who cares for a title, is lost and needs to be found, an  in need of a personality,  the individual, and  needed to be  served with love and sincerity.
