If you aren't familliar with the term 'cache', don't worry, we'll cover that in future videos.\n\nAs a user, you probably use CDNs all the time without realizing it. \n\nAs a developer, you may want to use CDNs like google libraries to help your page load more quickly.\n\nAs a company, a CDN would be useful if you want your product or site to reach users more efficiently in the larger scheme of their network and the internet as a whole.", "duration": "PT2M14S", "likes": "254", "views": "21957"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "jsphschmtt", "text": "http://www.globaldots.com/content-delivery-network-explained/", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Frank Cambell", "text": "Thanks for a great video!
