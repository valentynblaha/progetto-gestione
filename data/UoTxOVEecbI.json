In this tutorial we will go from basics to advanced and create multiple different pixel effects with vanilla JavaScript and HTML canvas.\n\nThe tutorial starts with a simple beginner friendly project, where we analyze image for pixel data and use it to color shift the image and turn it into grayscale. Then we use that basic knowledge in a powerful way to create many different advanced animations with vanilla JavaScript and HTML canvas, completely from scratch.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Code \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17Project 1 Smoke: https://codepen.io/franksLaboratory/details/ZEprPKx\n\ud83d\udd17Project 2 Rainbow: https://codepen.io/franksLaboratory/pen/MWjBPgB\n\ud83d\udd17Project 3 Fire: https://codepen.io/franksLaboratory/pen/XWjBPOx\n\ud83d\udd17Project 4 Particle text with liquid filter applied: https://codepen.io/franksLaboratory/pen/VwKEeqR\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Frank Dvorak.

With more complex effects like this some hand tweaking is usually required.

That way you could create let's say 4 carefully calibrated hand made pre-sets, and then based on what screen size user loads the website on (or when resize event is triggered), it would just choose one of them.
