First of all, don't add/use any library/tool if it's not necessary. Keep it simple. If you are learning just go for simple things like for Global state management use PullState instead of Redux, Material UI and stuff like that. Once you get comfortable with those then move to more mature solutions like Redux, Redux Thunk etc. There is no such silver bullet. You can use any tool/library, first make it work then improve. Redux is famous because all big projects opt for that and they opt because the customization it provides is on the next level. You can use MobX. The simple reason I see here is you are just making it overcomplicated or your case falls under premature optimization. Let yourself bump into a problem.

I'm new to react-query, but I think this is working as intended. From the docs: \"Out of the box, React Query is configured with aggressive but sane defaults. Sometimes these defaults can catch new users off guard or make learning/debugging difficult if they are unknown by the user. Query instances via useQuery or useInfiniteQuery by default consider cached data as stale...\" So for those that want a traditional caching experience, they can set the staleTime to a higher value, thus considering the data non-stale.", "likes": 2}, {"author": "Weibenfalk", "text": "Why do you think that?
