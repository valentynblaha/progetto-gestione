First of all, don't add/use any library/tool if it's not necessary. Keep it simple. If you are learning just go for simple things like for Global state management use PullState instead of Redux, Material UI and stuff like that. Once you get comfortable with those then move to more mature solutions like Redux, Redux Thunk etc. There is no such silver bullet. You can use any tool/library, first make it work then improve. Redux is famous because all big projects opt for that and they opt because the customization it provides is on the next level. You can use MobX. The simple reason I see here is you are just making it overcomplicated or your case falls under premature optimization. Let yourself bump into a problem.
