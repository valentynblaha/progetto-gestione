If you build a single page application with multiple routes and more complexity, then webpack will be the better option because of its code splitting features and modern feature set and it has a lot of community support and it has become the standard in the industry.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are building something simpler like a website maybe and you are using for example SASS, gulp might be the better option here for such simple tasks as compiling SASS to CSS or optimizing images for production or maybe even transpiling ES6 to ES5 javascript so you can write more modern javascript (since you probably won't write that much JS for a simple project), but still transpile it to javascript used by more browsers. Don't get me wrong, gulp can be used for bigger applications, but it's just that webpack handles it a lot better and is more modern after all.", "likes": 6}]}]}
