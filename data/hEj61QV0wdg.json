{"video": {"id": "hEj61QV0wdg", "title": "The Art of Web API Design", "description": "Web applications don't talk with front-end and database only anymore. They increasingly often talk with each other. In order not to get crazy in this communication mess, it\u2019s good to take a look at many aspects of creating web API. We will answer the \"why\", \"what\" and \"how\" questions to begin with. We will meet the three wizards: Morville, Fielding and Richardson. We will play with resources, behavior, relations, parameters, headers, collections, versioning, errors, security, throttling, cache, HATEOAS, management performance, health and business. There will be a bunch of tips on how to make consumers of our API happy. Warning: may contain traces of snakes and camels.\n\nTalk by Pawe\u0142 Zaj\u0105czkowski.\n\nThanks to Devoxx for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
