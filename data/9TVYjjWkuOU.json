I initially started from Freecodecamp.com and other tutorials, the more I learn about web technologies like javascript the more I want to learn lower level languages like c++. A part of me wants to go back to college and study computer science. I have done a little research and many seem to say that it is not necessary but I want be marketable for a career in software development. I have read that the industry is being flooded with junior developers that don't know enough to be productive so I suppose that is why I think I need to go back to school. I had been applying to companies that fit my skill set and I haven't received one response regarding an interview.\nI would really appreciate your advice on whether I should bite the bullet and go back to college or keep getting better at javascript and web technologies ie react, angular...\n\nAnswer:\n[See video]\n\nAbout Preethi:\nPreethi Kasireddy is an engineer based in San Francisco. She's an avid learner who taught herself programming and machine learning, and is passionate about understanding things clearly and explaining them to others via blog posts.\n\nShe was previously a front-end & API engineer at Coinbase, a digital currency platform, where she helped architect and rebuild their front-end in React, Mobx and Redux. Prior to that, she was a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an Investment Banker at Goldman Sachs.

It\u2019s hard when you are the only one in your friends with a specific goal. I have a bachelor degree in nursing, and I\u2019m doing a graduate diploma in digital health. I want to work in the development oh health technologies for space ( I already work in the implementation of health tech in clinical settings and work in clinical informatics). And, I want to go back and do a computer science degree to complete the loop of my clinical side, the management side and the tech side in order to get the type of job I have. Jobs working in the development of health tech requires always a comps sci or eng. Degree. My profile is too clinical\u2026 and to work in the space industry, they like when you have many skills\u2026! \nSo there is my question! Should I do it? I\u2019m participating in the canadian space agency challenge to create a health tech for astronauts, I\u2019m part of a space health team in the experimental biotechnology team\u2026 so Being there I see they all are eng.

I would like to offer my perspective from a regular person born to a middle class family. I went to college and got my CS degree despite knowing enough programming to get a full-time job in high school, and am now working at a very large corporation. If I had not gone to college, there is no possible way I would be working as a software engineer. Recruiters would have ignored my resume if I did not have a college in degree on it. If you are a regular person like me with no major connections, going to college is the only way you can get a real, well-paying software engineering job before you hit 30. \nAlso, she went to Hack Reactor, which is a very selective boot camp with a 3% admit rate. Most people who get into good boot camps already have college degrees from good schools and already have prestigious careers. I dislike the idea that anyone who works hard can get into the software field - the truth is that if you don't have the right connections or the right qualifications (like a college degree or major work experience) then most recruiters will ignore your resume regardless of how great your github profile is. Please, go to college if you can, especially if you are a high school student. It is worth the investment.", "likes": 62}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugih0NNY-aOrb3gCoAEC.8UtSRNvmTZZ92mjpqxjeh0", "publishedAt": "2019-12-21T01:32:41Z", "author": "Uzair Akram", "text": "Also you have to be realistic with yourself, some of the projects I did for my class, I would have never been able to do them at the pace that I did if I was doing independent learning.

What really matters IS your network. And academic degrees can give you that network if you do not have any other way to make connections in the field. But they will not give you any kind of knowledge that you will never get otherwise. Academic curriculum, literature lists, experienced mentors and study groups are openly available nowadays, so nothing prevents you to follow CS degree path without actually going to the college.
