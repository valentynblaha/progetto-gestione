I initially started from Freecodecamp.com and other tutorials, the more I learn about web technologies like javascript the more I want to learn lower level languages like c++. A part of me wants to go back to college and study computer science. I have done a little research and many seem to say that it is not necessary but I want be marketable for a career in software development. I have read that the industry is being flooded with junior developers that don't know enough to be productive so I suppose that is why I think I need to go back to school. I had been applying to companies that fit my skill set and I haven't received one response regarding an interview.\nI would really appreciate your advice on whether I should bite the bullet and go back to college or keep getting better at javascript and web technologies ie react, angular...\n\nAnswer:\n[See video]\n\nAbout Preethi:\nPreethi Kasireddy is an engineer based in San Francisco. She's an avid learner who taught herself programming and machine learning, and is passionate about understanding things clearly and explaining them to others via blog posts.\n\nShe was previously a front-end & API engineer at Coinbase, a digital currency platform, where she helped architect and rebuild their front-end in React, Mobx and Redux. Prior to that, she was a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an Investment Banker at Goldman Sachs. She studied Systems Engineering at USC.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/iam_preethi\n\n-\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com", "duration": "PT13M22S", "likes": "1406", "views": "72405"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Najwa Al moh", "text": "I dont get computer science dgree but I lern Front end devolper\nData analyst", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Najwa Al moh", "text": "Thank you", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Beatriz Andrade", "text": "Thank you for the video!

I would like to offer my perspective from a regular person born to a middle class family. I went to college and got my CS degree despite knowing enough programming to get a full-time job in high school, and am now working at a very large corporation. If I had not gone to college, there is no possible way I would be working as a software engineer. Recruiters would have ignored my resume if I did not have a college in degree on it. If you are a regular person like me with no major connections, going to college is the only way you can get a real, well-paying software engineering job before you hit 30. \nAlso, she went to Hack Reactor, which is a very selective boot camp with a 3% admit rate. Most people who get into good boot camps already have college degrees from good schools and already have prestigious careers. I dislike the idea that anyone who works hard can get into the software field - the truth is that if you don't have the right connections or the right qualifications (like a college degree or major work experience) then most recruiters will ignore your resume regardless of how great your github profile is.

Being able to have meaningful discussions with peers and interviewers about these topics regardless of the coding language will impress more than knowledge of any particular language or framework. Many of the good interviews will have you explaining your thought process as you work through a given problem long before being required to tap away at a keyboard in the language of choice.\n\nhttps://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017", "likes": 8}, "replies": [{"author": "emma green", "text": "Well, 25% have no degree whatsoever and from those that have a degree 25% have a non \"computers\" related degree.\n\nThose numbers might be considered small but they are actually huge.\nIn theory, you have 1 in 4 chances to become as successful as someone that has decades worth of higher education.\n\nThose odds are extremely good actually.\n\nOf course it all comes down to how good a learner you are as 90% of devs are self-taught to some degree.", "likes": 3}, {"author": "Moetasim Rady", "text": "Darren Evans Thus, getting a degree is kind of a big deal unlike what this video's all about.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jonathan Turla", "text": "Thank you so much.

Contradictory to that is how HR departments will use a degree as a way to sort our resumes. There are a few good ways to get around this.\n1. Make your own interview. Hand deliver your application to an HR manager and strike up a conversation about the company. Your physical presence will make you stand out far more than a piece of paper.\n2. Award yourself a degree. Check with a few colleges to make sure your experience includes the majority of their curriculum (minus the math and general study courses).
