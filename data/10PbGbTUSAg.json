Here's a lot of information you may find interesting: \n\n- This is a nice course for you to learn how to do stuff in Azure and some theory. It helped me a lot in the exam, but I would probably have failed if I have only used this to study.  Andrew is not to be blamed either! The exam is just a bit bizarre. Tricky questions, strangely worded descriptions, long case studies that you can waste several minutes reading when it is not really necessary.\n\n- I strongly recommend Udemy's \"AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Practice Tests 2022\" from Cloud Connect. I don't know if they sneaked a camera into the exam or what, but the questions are THE SAME as the IRL exam. Those practice exams carried me through my certification.  Memorize the answers from those tests and you're set!  Their explanations SUCK though. Stick to Andrew's content for that.\n\n- I got 50% off the exam for completing the \"30 Days to Learn It!\"  learning path from Microsoft (google it!). You subscribe, skip to the last 10 seconds of each lecture to mark them as completed, answer whatever on the knowledge tests (you need to complete it, not pass it) and at the end you get a voucher.  It takes a while (1,5 hour, maybe?) but hey... 50% off is A LOT in my local currency.\n\n-My exam had 49 questions, awkwardly divided and badly explained:   33 regular questions (multiple choice, multiple answers, true/false, etc); 10 \"same scenario\" questions divided in 3 scenarios; and 6 \"case study\" questions, all of them for the same case study.   All of that in 100 minutes (1 hour and 40 minutes).   That is not even CLOSE to the number of questions OR duration I read was expected for the AZ-104. Looks like each person's test is different.   One reason why I think I only got 49 questions is that a lot of questions expected 2 or 3 answers, each worth one point.  \n\n- My progress meter was a mess. it showed \"X out of 49\" where X = (1 to 43)  for the regular questions.... then it reset to \"1 out of 49\" for the last part (case study) and went from 1 to 6.  If the meter doesn't make sense just ignore it and focus on the time left. I would leave 25 min for each case study.\n\n- \"Same Scenario\" questions are questions that have the same exact description but different answers in each. For instance: the description says you want to accomplish something in Azure. The 1st question asks how to do it in PowerShell, the 2nd in CLI, and the 3rd using the portal.  The catch is that once you answer a question you cannot go back! So if the 3rd question solves the 1st you cannot go back and fix it. The trick is learning to let go. If you find out you goofed the first ones, just ease your mind and carry on. I got 3 scenarios:  3 questions for scenario A, 3 questions for scenario B and 4 questions for scenario C.\n\n- \"Case Study\" is quite stupid, imho. They give you an ungodly amount of information for a fake company (Overview, Existing Environment, Planned Changes and Technical Requirements) that you are supposed to read and understand before answering the questions. The problem is that once you memorize all that and go to the questions, they: 1) are basic af,  2) use 10% of the info provided.  My suggestion: Ignore the information and go straight to the question.  Find out what they want you to answer and THEN go back to the documentation. That way you can filter only what you need from the text.  If I've tried to make sense of the text before I went to the questions, I would have ran out of time. \n\n- I can't prove it and I know it sounds stupid, but I honestly think the small assessment at the begining of the test where they ask you how knowledgeable you are in each topic changes the pool of questions they draw yours from. I answered \"I can do stuff guided by an instructor or detailed instructions\" for each topic (which I believe is one above \"I have no idea what I am doing\" or something) and I got 1 case study. My friend was not as modest and got 3 case studies! We had the same difficulty difference on the AZ-900 exam.  I may need a tin foil hat, but it didn't hurt me to be humble yet.\n\n\nGood luck!!", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugx2TqHV36Skr78PBhd4AaABAg.9gA4hbvofst9kz-fJRElzK", "publishedAt": "2023-01-17T07:23:26Z", "author": "Joe arithmi", "text": "Amazing, thanks.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugx2TqHV36Skr78PBhd4AaABAg.9gA4hbvofst9jact0Xs-9O", "publishedAt": "2022-12-13T23:42:25Z", "author": "M", "text": "Thanks for the info mate!
