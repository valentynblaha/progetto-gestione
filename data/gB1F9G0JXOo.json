HP turns red when it gets low enough and reverts back to black when it heals past the danger zone, is green when full. I've set up a punching bag dummy that can receive damage which responds to the P2 health gauge. On my little tester stage, I've set up a red block and a green block that are hurt and heal boxes to test out damage.\nI'm actually glad you asked, because I've been feeling down on myself about not having too much time set aside to work on it, but in hindsight I've gotten quite a bit done for a beginner, so my motivation is high now.

Say you're writing a game, and you have a dozen different enemies who all drop a fixed amount of gold when they die, so you put that in a variable and call it from a bunch of places. Now let's say you have a special event running for a month where you want enemies to drop extra gold - if you've used getters, you can factor the extra gold into the getter in one place. If you've used public variables, you'd have to update every instance where you'd directly accessed the variable (and just end up creating your own getter anyway).\n\nThere are other reasons to use them too, and it's worth reading up on setters/getters/accessors, but also if you decide you genuinely don't need them and the code is more readable/maintainable without them, that's fine too.

The reason for this is because FixedUpdate is not a frame by frame process, but is called at fixed time increments which can be more or less calls in a certain frame period.\n\n\r\n\r\nInput data is determined every frame, so in FixedUpdate where it can run in-between frames, skip frames, etc. you have the possibility of losing input. Instead, move your input code to the Update method which is called every frame. You will no longer lose input.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe issue with setting your physics calls in Update is because all physics code should be placed in FixedUpdate. As Update can run faster or slower than the physics system in your game, placing physics-based calls in it can have unexpected results.\"", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzw1lAn7_eg2fw3ovh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-12-08T14:00:52Z", "author": "Mufiq Patoni", "text": "i need subtitles", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxUhxol4ypND_FDhA94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-12-07T15:49:21Z", "author": "AMAN KUMAR YADAV", "text": "Great work", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx4RZMKZl7VSpCY50R4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-12-07T12:23:41Z", "author": "Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndez", "text": "Thank you very much for the time you put into making this tutorial.\nI've managed to complete the game by trying to figure out how to do things before watching how you did it.

Basically I'm wondering if component references are mutable from copies of a reference.\n\nIf you know a lot about C#, you know that there's a major distinction between reference types and value types ... and you can make a reference type behave *like* a value type (or even vice-versa!) depending on what you're trying to do (like have a singleton object, for instance, pun intended, wow that was clever \ud83d\udc4f lol) ... I just dunno how Unity implemented their components ...", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyfQwPU5bXEheeNYIJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-24T19:06:13Z", "author": "BsID", "text": "Wow 7 hours.. ur amazing", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxJ-MoyVMfGShwJbMx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-24T12:39:13Z", "author": "Iulian Biro", "text": "the fact that you're using names like Health _health and health again, makes it pretty confusing for a begginer\nanyway, very helpful!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz0rKYsz0dh7BvJYK54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-24T10:12:58Z", "author": "Ushing Marma", "text": "You are so crazy bro.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz9g2nuVgOTX4hUcAl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-24T08:13:19Z", "author": "Mega Techno", "text": "46:45", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyi35Wq_TzXrmwBvQp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-24T05:28:42Z", "author": "Khairun Nisa", "text": "Hi everyone, excuse me for asking.

The answer would be the string! \n\nLets also consider another example, int vs string, lets say you have 12345 as a value for both the int and string, the int will only hold the value 12345 as a whole number, you can not find the 3 position of the number with ease as it is stored as a full number and you would have to convert it to a string or mathematically separate the number to process the position number, where as the string is already an array of chars, so to find position 3 in the string is as simple as calling the 2 position in its array!\n\nJust mentioning it as the string is more then what you presented!", "likes": 14}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwyjHC7NRVAftwavRZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-08T13:01:29Z", "author": "Elite Gamer", "text": "Thanks for the free content, would love it if the mic recording was mono audio because this unbalanced audio hurts", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzATZxHb40fGeujr2F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-08T10:19:58Z", "author": "Aronas LTU", "text": "Sorry but i can't get assets of the game, what do i do ???", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxarRIi2B9L0o5uMNl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-08T01:40:05Z", "author": "James Yan", "text": "Great tutorial, thank you.\nA question about the \"Delegates and Events\":\n\nIn the \"event and delegate\" video, the delegate variable and event variable are both being defined at the beginning of the code using \"public delegate\" and \"public static event\" which I can understand that a static variable (event) can be called from another code using Sender.[event_name] and it can subscribe with the functions. \n\nHowever, in game development, the GameManager.cs doesn't define the event \"sceneLoaded\" nor a delegate.

One of the main ideas of object-oriented programming is that classes wrap simple data with *behavior* and it\u2019s the class\u2019s responsibility to define the behavior logic.\n\nFor example, say you start your game with a Player class and give it an ageInYears field (variable), and you just ask the user to input an age in years. Later you decide to make Player have a birthdate. So now you can calculate ageInYears from the birthdate instead. That logic can be defined in the class, and nothing else should be allowed to set ageInYears from outside because it might not match the birthdate with correct logic.\n\nIf you used `ageInYears { get }` from the beginning, then code outside Player can only get it through a function/method call instead of reading the variable directly. When you add birthdate, you change the `ageInYears { get }` to a `int ageInYears()` method with the birthdate logic, and old outside code that used the getter still works, nothing breaks.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwBhux-Qk2pTWXjnjF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T13:23:11Z", "author": "Joh Hatomii", "text": "Great stuff", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz0QoBt4YA6sWdMPhV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T11:23:08Z", "author": "Ryan Manchikanti", "text": "How do we deploy this anywhere??.... anybody ??", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy_Z28IZ99KSGyOAVd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T07:49:35Z", "author": "Adrian Somor", "text": "Very good video Fahir.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzvfT9_Z1o6j4EsHlB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T06:12:57Z", "author": "Meeth Sangani", "text": "Which computer language is being used in the video?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzvfT9_Z1o6j4EsHlB4AaABAg.9MJ4Ruq_KNP9MJkvQ2sQJs", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T12:32:51Z", "author": "Meeth Sangani", "text": "@Tushar Gaurav ohk thanks", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzvfT9_Z1o6j4EsHlB4AaABAg.9MJ4Ruq_KNP9MJgcVdPRHy", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T11:55:19Z", "author": "Tushar Gaurav", "text": "C# is used for the scripts.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwNgBlbhtVCy5eN5FJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T02:26:43Z", "author": "Delgado", "text": "I can't access those links in description", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwNgBlbhtVCy5eN5FJ4AaABAg.9MIfYwXDsfS9MJibvl9k2-", "publishedAt": "2021-04-19T12:12:43Z", "author": "Delgado", "text": "@Tushar Gaurav I'll try later.
