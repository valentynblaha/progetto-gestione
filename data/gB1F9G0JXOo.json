Say you're writing a game, and you have a dozen different enemies who all drop a fixed amount of gold when they die, so you put that in a variable and call it from a bunch of places. Now let's say you have a special event running for a month where you want enemies to drop extra gold - if you've used getters, you can factor the extra gold into the getter in one place. If you've used public variables, you'd have to update every instance where you'd directly accessed the variable (and just end up creating your own getter anyway).\n\nThere are other reasons to use them too, and it's worth reading up on setters/getters/accessors, but also if you decide you genuinely don't need them and the code is more readable/maintainable without them, that's fine too.

The reason for this is because FixedUpdate is not a frame by frame process, but is called at fixed time increments which can be more or less calls in a certain frame period.\n\n\r\n\r\nInput data is determined every frame, so in FixedUpdate where it can run in-between frames, skip frames, etc. you have the possibility of losing input. Instead, move your input code to the Update method which is called every frame. You will no longer lose input.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe issue with setting your physics calls in Update is because all physics code should be placed in FixedUpdate.

For instance, if I say var obj = GetSomeComponent(); did I just obtain a direct reference to the object that exists in the Unity API, or did I get a new, local copy of the object? When I modify public properties of my variable obj does it modify the original Unity component I'm referencing, or do I have to make all my changes to my local obj and then assign that value to the Unity component to change it? Basically I'm wondering if component references are mutable from copies of a reference.\n\nIf you know a lot about C#, you know that there's a major distinction between reference types and value types ... and you can make a reference type behave *like* a value type (or even vice-versa!) depending on what you're trying to do (like have a singleton object, for instance, pun intended, wow that was clever \ud83d\udc4f lol) ...

Later you decide to make Player have a birthdate. So now you can calculate ageInYears from the birthdate instead. That logic can be defined in the class, and nothing else should be allowed to set ageInYears from outside because it might not match the birthdate with correct logic.\n\nIf you used `ageInYears { get }` from the beginning, then code outside Player can only get it through a function/method call instead of reading the variable directly. When you add birthdate, you change the `ageInYears { get }` to a `int ageInYears()` method with the birthdate logic, and old outside code that used the getter still works, nothing breaks.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Joh Hatomii", "text": "Great stuff", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ryan Manchikanti", "text": "How do we deploy this anywhere??.... anybody ??", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Adrian Somor", "text": "Very good video Fahir.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Meeth Sangani", "text": "Which computer language is being used in the video?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Meeth Sangani", "text": "@Tushar Gaurav ohk thanks", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Tushar Gaurav", "text": "C# is used for the scripts.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Delgado", "text": "I can't access those links in description", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Delgado", "text": "@Tushar Gaurav I'll try later.

Last I checked HDRP was a buggy mess that would fold-up in any real project that would ship to production. Why do you think unity are so obsessed with 3 minute demos? That's where they can flex their muscles. I have been developing games for nearly 20 years and I can see through that. It's not just graphics that makes unreal engine superior, it is by far a more stable engine that has solid foundation built by excellent minds.
