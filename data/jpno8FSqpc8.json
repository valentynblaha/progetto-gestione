First of all - I have got an exam today and have passed, I have used this course, few lessons from Google course and 96 questions from ExamTopics (but only up to 10% came from there on the exam). I REALLY HATE that ALMOST 50% of WHOLE course is dedicated to the network. I get it, the instructor is a person with networking background but it doesn\u2019t matter, course should be compensated and friendly for everyone. It\u2019s great to know some details but it will be more than enough to know about 5 characteristics of all of them (I.e. interconnect used to private connection, VPC has subnets, Shared VPC if we want to share multiple VPC\u2019s etc, there is no need to know it on low level). About other things:\n- I thought this course was recorded in 2022 (as published date suggested) but in reality it was recorded in 2020, 3 years ago. 2023 should be the last year to learn from this imho as resources are changing and you\u2019re learning legacy/outdated information, sometimes even services doesn\u2019t exists anymore\n- because of this course recorded 3 years ago, it is missing few services that I have seen in the exam and in the exam dumps\n- I guess that exam might have changed since 2020 as in the 96 questions and in my exam I haven\u2019t seen any ML related questions so you don\u2019t have to pay that much attention to it (but you still should)\n- GKE and Compute Engines are major topics in the exam, you should focus most on it. Also IAM is important, as well as billing.\nOverall - I enjoyed this course and I am glad for it but with proper network information, this course would take 10 hours top, not 20 hours so it\u2019s a big waste of time (if you\u2019re not interested in networking, as many software engineers aren\u2019t)", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxrRSM5eNljUoWmCmd4AaABAg.9ka1ZTh4l1Y9knZOztFBN2", "publishedAt": "2023-01-12T20:44:45Z", "author": "Sawanstor", "text": "@Tobeskoko Atobes examtopics", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgxrRSM5eNljUoWmCmd4AaABAg.9ka1ZTh4l1Y9knVIhNNtSI", "publishedAt": "2023-01-12T20:08:56Z", "author": "Tobeskoko Atobes", "text": "What exam dumps did you use or where can I get exam dumps from?", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgxrRSM5eNljUoWmCmd4AaABAg.9ka1ZTh4l1Y9kbuFS3XUGE", "publishedAt": "2023-01-08T08:04:48Z", "author": "Sawanstor", "text": "@Tobeskoko Atobes this video while taking notes + some exam dumps (even to just see the structure of the questions) should be enough to pass.
