Can you please explain what you meant by this and how traffic gets routed to the new ASG? Thanks", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "ATRAPS", "text": "hi jared, I might be wrong but this is my thought process regarding your question. Single-instance web environment would consist of an EC2 instance with an Elastic IP attached. Although a single-instance environment does use the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service, settings for the minimum number of instances, maximum number of instances, and desired capacity are all set to 1. Therefore, in an immutable deployment for single-instance web env, firstly a new ASG with min/max/desired=1 will be created. A new EC2 with the updates will be created. Once the new EC2 passes health checks, the traffic would be routed to the new ASG's EC2 which would have the original EC2's Elastic IP attached to it now. So there wont be a need for an ELB to point to the new ASG. From route53's perspective, it is still routing to the same Elastic IP address, it is probably just a matter of the Elastic IP switch from old EC2 to new EC2. This is just my two cents on this matter.
