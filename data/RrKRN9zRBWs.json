Single-instance web environment would consist of an EC2 instance with an Elastic IP attached. Although a single-instance environment does use the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service, settings for the minimum number of instances, maximum number of instances, and desired capacity are all set to 1. Therefore, in an immutable deployment for single-instance web env, firstly a new ASG with min/max/desired=1 will be created. A new EC2 with the updates will be created. Once the new EC2 passes health checks, the traffic would be routed to the new ASG's EC2 which would have the original EC2's Elastic IP attached to it now. So there wont be a need for an ELB to point to the new ASG. From route53's perspective, it is still routing to the same Elastic IP address, it is probably just a matter of the Elastic IP switch from old EC2 to new EC2. This is just my two cents on this matter.

I studied this video course for the developer exam and followed it throughout and completed the course in 2 weeks. Bought practice tests online and practiced them for a week, I did only 5 exams. Sturdiest about 5-6 hours a day. Final day of exam went through the cheat sheet links of this video course twice and then gave and passed my exam yesterday. I must say the Developer exam was super-duper tough. I had to think and rethink on the options I was to select. I lost a lot of time on some questions. I could not complete all questions and could answer 63 of the 65 questions in 130 mins. There was not a single direct question from the practice exams that I bought that appeared, but I think what would\u2019ve helped me do correct selection of answers that led me to pass is : The knowledge and conceptual understanding that I had developed  when I sincerely completed the follow throughs of this video course and also the part I had studied for Practitioner exam that would\u2019ve built my fundamentals and while going through the practice exams for this exam I went in detail about the explanation of the incorrect options as well alongwith the correct answer.\n\nThanks a lot to this course and freecodecamp for my journey in this certification, but anyone reading this I would like to tell the exam difficulty level I\u2019ll say was very tough and to tell my background, I have 12 years exp in Software Dev, Design and Operations and good fundamental knowledge of Cloud computing but had no AWS knowledge prior to my AWS Practitioner.
