Is there a benefit to using the spread operator here as well?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Raquel Betancourt", "text": "I read your question when I was beginning to understand this concept and I was wondering the same thing, now that I am a little deeper into it I remembered your question and I can give you an answer\n\nYou must understand that in javascript there are two types of data\r\n\r\n1. Primitives that are saved by value (numbers, booleans, strings, null, undefined, symbul, bigInt)\r\n\r\n2. Compounds that are saved by reference (objects, arrays, functions)\r\n\r\nSo suppose you have two variables\r\n\r\nlet a = 10;\r\nlet b = a; // b = 10\r\n\r\nWhat happens here is that Javascript saves both answers in different memory spaces making a copy of this\r\n\r\nFor example, when you use a photocopier, and you make a copy of a page, you have two completely different sheets, so if you break or scratch one of them, the other will not be affected, so, in the same code we do the following:\r\n\r\na = 20;\r\nb; // b = 10\r\n\r\nwe will have that \"b\" will continue to be \"10\" since it was the value that was assigned to it at the beginning, it doesnt matter if \"a\" was changed\n\nNow let's talk about data types that are saved by reference\r\n\r\nLet's say we have the following\r\n\r\nlet array1 = [a,b,c];\r\nlet array2 = array1 // array2 = [a,b,c]\r\n\r\nThis type of data does not work the same as primitive data, here Javascript is not saved by value, it is saved by reference, so suppose there is a memory space called A1B2C3, in that memory space Javascript is going to save the value assigned to array1 and therefore the copy is made by that name/reference, so what we are really doing is\r\n\r\nlet array1 = A1B2C3;\r\nlet array2 = array1; // array2 = A1B2C3\r\n\r\nBeing A1B2C3 = [a,b,c]\r\n\r\nSo let's say that I want an array2 with the same data as array1, but I want to make some modifications to array2, but I want array1 to continue the same, what we could think of doing is\r\n\r\nlet array1 = [a,b,c];\r\nlet array2 = array1;\r\n\r\narray2.push(d);\r\n\r\nWhat ->we would expect<- to happen is\r\n\r\narray1; // [a,b,c]\r\narray2; //[a,b,c,d]\r\n\r\nbut what ->really happens<- is\r\n\r\narray1; //[a,b,c,d]\r\narray2;//[a,b,c,d]\r\n\r\nbut why? if I am modifying array2, not array1?\n\n\r\nThis happens because you are not modifying the value of the array, we are modifying the value of the reference, and since they both point to the same reference then you are modifying both.\r\n\r\nHow to solve it? using the spread operator, since when making a copy of the array, we are not taking the same reference, but we are creating a new one, so what you should do is\r\n\r\nlet array1 = [a,b,c];\r\nlet array2 = [...array1];\r\n\r\narray2.push(d);\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\narray1 // [a,b,c]\r\narray2 // [a,b,c,d] \n\nHope this helps!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nebojsa Pavlovic", "text": "Thanks Beau!
