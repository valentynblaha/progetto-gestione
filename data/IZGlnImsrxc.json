In this video, Mike Williams shares his story on how he came up with the idea for Studiotime (http://www.studiotime.io) and built the MVP in an evening, launched on Product Hunt, and generated over 1M hits to the site. Studiotime was then immediately featured in media outlets such as Forbes, BBC, HYPEBEAST, The FADER, Complex, Pigeons & Planes, and more. Studiotime went from an evening side project, MVP that generated over $10k+ revenue in months, and is now the largest online music studio marketplace in the world. \n\nCheck out part 2: https://youtu.be/xBasvuRUm4w\n\nResources shared in this video: \n\nSharetribe (Marketplace platform): http://bit.ly/2gXICOV \nSquarespace Logo: https://logo.squarespace.com \nProduct Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com \n\nLearn more about creator Mike Williams: http://www.iammikewilliams.com\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com", "duration": "PT11M37S", "likes": "348", "views": "13233"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxOvRE2GfeO2Uayg8d4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-14T13:00:33Z", "author": "The Hustle Network", "text": "Generate more demands in the marketplace\n\nWOW so glad I came across your video.
