In this video, Mike Williams shares his story on how he came up with the idea for Studiotime (http://www.studiotime.io) and built the MVP in an evening, launched on Product Hunt, and generated over 1M hits to the site. Studiotime was then immediately featured in media outlets such as Forbes, BBC, HYPEBEAST, The FADER, Complex, Pigeons & Planes, and more. Studiotime went from an evening side project, MVP that generated over $10k+ revenue in months, and is now the largest online music studio marketplace in the world. \n\nCheck out part 2: https://youtu.be/xBasvuRUm4w\n\nResources shared in this video: \n\nSharetribe (Marketplace platform): http://bit.ly/2gXICOV \nSquarespace Logo: https://logo.squarespace.com \nProduct Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com \n\nLearn more about creator Mike Williams: http://www.iammikewilliams.com\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com", "duration": "PT11M37S", "likes": "348", "views": "13168"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "The Hustle Network", "text": "Generate more demands in the marketplace\n\nWOW so glad I came across your video.

As you eluded to towards the end, the challenge of how to present the buyer with the quality of the studio could be a challenge initially. but as in the Airbnb market, quality will eventually show itself through customer comments, price and to a certain degree description of equipment and recording environment.  I see you have Studio's broken down by type which is a good start.  Eventually, you may want to also have search options for specific gear/technologies or specific environmental requirements.  I have have a few more important ideas for you to consider in the future if you wish to discuss offline.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Mike Williams", "text": "Thanks for the comments Craig and great input!
