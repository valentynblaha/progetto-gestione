For some reason, when I toggle the boxes and then press play, my toggled boxes immediately disappear. Seems to not be applying my toggled boxes to the state or something. I checked my code against the repo and it's identical, I wonder why the difference in outcome. I will spend some time trying to figure that out... \nThanks again though, this video is a really great, fun, detailed, and thorough walkthrough!!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzP_l7TY8ddT01wDBF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2017-10-05T00:12:27Z", "author": "Jon Grant", "text": "I'm getting an infinite loop when I try to run this on CodePen:\n\nclass Box extends React.Component {\n  selectBox = () => {\n    this.props.selectBox(this.props.row, this.props.col);\n  }\n\nIf I leave it like this, it gives me an error: unexpected token =\nIf I add a semicolon after the last curly bracket, I get an infinite loop.

I just finished this challenge on FCC and need to refactor because at larger sizes it goes slow.  This tutorial helped with that.  I am still learning, but instead of using your helper function to create a copy of the nested array, couldn't you just use the native callback provided by the setState() function?  For the selectBox() function It looks like this:\nselectBox = (row, col) =>{\n  this.setState((previousState)=>{\n    let {gridFull} = previousState;\n    gridFull[row][col] = !gridFull[row][col]\n    return {gridFull: gridFull }\n  });\n}", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzbuA7w26E_dJbwaMt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2017-10-01T16:47:59Z", "author": "Powka44", "text": "In the code line 191 (it's line 107 when first pasted at 36:10) first condition is 'if (i < this.rows - 1 && this.cols - 1)'.
