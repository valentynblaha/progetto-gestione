It is estimated that over 200 billion devices contain an ARM chip, making the ARM language valuable to understand. By understanding an assembly language, programmers can have a better understanding of how code is compiled and run, making it possible to create more efficient programs. In addition to this, programmers can work at a lower level, allowing them to write code that interacts with hardware in an efficient manner.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Scott Cosentino created this course.

First, note that regardless of processor endian-ness, the number in a multi-byte register will always be represented with most significant figure to the left (the way we write numbers on paper). The only difference will be in that which byte is at which address within address range of the register, and that would be important only if we iterate over bytes one at a time (e.g. sending an array of them to a character device in correct order).\nIt is Big endian if the most significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register (the way we usually write and read numbers).\nIt is Little endian if least significant byte is at address offset 0 from the base address of the register.\n\nApparently, Big endian arrangement comes \"naturally\" from our historical representation of Arab (Indian) numeral numbers, but Little endian is arrangement which had unique advantage: it enabled much cleaner (a single, simpler iterative loop) multi-word arithmetics (addition and subtraction), especially if the numbers were of different lengths (so we would start e.g. adding them  lower parts first, and if there was a carry, we would take it into account in next iteration with higher numeral positions).", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ricardo_", "text": "More important to learn how to read assembly code/understand how it works than to write assembly code for most people", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Starling Media", "text": "I believe they should be \"C\" between Assembly language and High level language", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Dev Pro", "text": "bruh what am i doing with my life? studying assembly to develop my own freaking os", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Arnav Saha", "text": "At this point, you guys are just reading my mind unethically on what content I exactly need OMG OMG OMG!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "lone wolf coding", "text": "hmmm what about risc v an open source architecture", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Service Rh", "text": "Your video was very helpful, I'm still learning and getting the hang of it still.

The \"stack\" name refers to an area of memory with very specific rules of access and usage.\n- With an AND operation it might be really interesting to have the \"Z\"ero flag set by \"ANDS\". Just think working with bitmaps even in high level languages. Not to mention an testing input pins in an embedded system.\n\n1:52:43 - The whole explanation around the \"SWITCH\" equate is a mess.
