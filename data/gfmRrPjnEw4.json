It is estimated that over 200 billion devices contain an ARM chip, making the ARM language valuable to understand. By understanding an assembly language, programmers can have a better understanding of how code is compiled and run, making it possible to create more efficient programs. In addition to this, programmers can work at a lower level, allowing them to write code that interacts with hardware in an efficient manner.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Scott Cosentino created this course.
