However I ended up learning it myself through Google searches, inference, and comparing sample diagrams. As it turns out, you don't need a video to explain this, you could learn it all in < 5 mins by reading an article.  Important things you should know:\n\nCrows Foot, ERD, UML, Class Diagram, etc, these are all different names for basically the same thing. Even though their qualities aren't identical, all these terms get used interchangeably and there are very minor differences between them. \n\n*ERD*: an entity relationship diagram is ANY visual representation of a business or database. ERDs can have different notations, like crows foot or UML notation, but they are both still ERDs because they are visual diagrams. An ERD is literally just a visual diagram of the entities.\n\n*Cardinality*: The relationship between any two entities. It can be represented by 1 to 1, 1 to many, or many to many.  \n\nA payment and a receipt has a 1 to 1 relationship bc for each payment there is one and only one receipt, and for each receipt there is one and only one payment. Another example is a monogamous relationship, for 1 husband there is only 1 wife and vice versa.\n\nA Mother to Son relationship is one to many because, a son can have only one mother, but the mother can birth many sons.\n\nMany to many relationship: Student and Class, because each student can have many classes and each class can have many students.\n\n*Crows Foot*: The thing that looks like this >-----< or like this --||-----< or something similar. Its a quick and easy way to visually represent cardinality. >--< is many to many, -||--||- is one to one, >--||- is one to many, -o--< is zero to many, etc.\n\n*UML class diagram*: Exactly the same thing as an ERD, but NOT using crows foot notation. Instead of crows foot, it uses *numbers* to show cardinality. For example 1 is one and only one. 0..1 is zero or one, 1...* Is one or many, etc.\n\nThere's also something called *chen notation* which is the most simplified version of the ERD of them all. In Chen notation you don't need to list any attributes, PKs, FKs... It's consist purely of the entities and the cardinalities.\n\nThere is a dense amount of information... it's super technical and wordy but often times its much more simple than it seems.  Try to filter out the unnecessary information and retain only the most important concepts . Make sure you understand all the different notations, primary and foreign keys, cardinality, inheritance, functional dependence/independence, and normalization up to 3NF. Conceptually it's not difficult to grasp, and one you learn all that you can finally start with SQL which is a LOT less boring \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude02", "likes": 3}, {"id": "UgzTqIL1480QQnIaneh4AaABAg.9SdUbTdFr-R9XVIIdsLbYY", "publishedAt": "2022-01-22T09:50:15Z", "author": "Moid Qureshi", "text": "Same here.
