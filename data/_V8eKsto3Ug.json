But in terms of analysis \u2013\u00a0that is, trying to understand the trends and not just predict them \u2013\u00a0it is possible that something like R is more common. Really, you'd do best to find a few people who do what you're interested in and then ask them what they use. (And it's worth remembering that ANYBODY working in finance should be completely fluent in Microsoft Excel. Really.) As for universities, I don't know, but if the program has \"data science\" in the title, it will probably emphasize machine learning and Python, whereas if it has something like \"financial analysis\" in the title, it may be R.

You're absolutely right that Python's popularity has been growing and that it passed R a couple years ago on software for data science. Python is a wonderful language and I strongly to encourage anyone working in data science to learn Python in addition to R. But I think the change in popularity has more to do with a shift in the practice of data science, where there is a much greater emphasis on machine learning (including neural networks and deep learning) than there was a few years ago. I would generally recommend Python for anyone doing that kind of machine learning (although R is able to do most of it, too). \n\n\nBut I don't think R is going to disappear because it tends to fill a different niche than R. R is extraordinarily well adapted for data ANALYSIS, more so than Python, I believe. For example, I'm an academic psychologist and I don't know a single psychological researcher who uses Python for data analysis but I know a great number who use R.

I tell them that after they understand the basics it becomes easy to quickly learn the basics .  If you understand the basics then corporate industry users do use SAS , Matlab , SPSS and other pay to use software but you look for packages or build your own  packages to quickly do your stats then confirm them with your business software.

I remember that one too. I hadn't thought about it for ages. I'm probably older than most on this thread. I used to program in Fortran and also assembly language when needed on the old IBM mainframes. At that time APL fascinated me when I heard about it. I wanted to do something with it but it was never quite right for what I wanted to do. When I saw your mention of APL,  I looked it up on Wikipedia. There it says \"APL has formed the basis of, or influenced, the following languages: \" and then it lists many languages including S. But S, of course, is the direct parent of R.  So you're right. APL did lead to R. Also Matlab and Mathematica according to Wiki.  This is what happens. Things change. I'm learning R now because I'm tired of the menus on SSPS for the statistical stuff I do. One can use R to extend SPSS anyway, so it's a very important thing to learn for anyone doing any statistics these days. And, in case you may wonder, though Fortran is very fast and there are new Fortrans available, I'll never program in that again. I used to love it but R is much easier to deal with. I used to use Fortran for statistical models of biophysical calculations I was making. But if R was available then, I would have dropped Fortran in a minute. Fortran is still useful in physics, at least that's what I read.  It's wicked fast though compiled C# (or ##) is about as fast now.
