In order your code to run, there has to be execution context. Creation of execution context consist of 2 phases: 1) Creation phase - your code is being SCANNED for variables and FUNCTION declarations and then reserve space in memory for variables and function declaration - That is ALL, ALL that is happening. That is so called hoisting. So in this phase, when your code is scanned and JS engine encounters function declaration, it reserve memory for your function and put it all in memory ( literally how it is written ). When it encounters VAR variable it also reserve space for this type of variable in memory. But IMPORTANT, in creation phase JS engine do not know what is the actual value of the VAR, so it puts UNDEFINED. LET and CONST are also HOISTED, but instead of initializing them to UNDEFINED it puts them into memory and so called TDZ or temporary zone is being created for LET and CONST. Meaning, you can not access this type of variables before they are lexically written. 2) In creation phase your code is executed line by line and during this phase your variables will get the real values.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzuRDvrawNSbkS5lpJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-09-08T09:00:23Z", "author": "Sidi Sting", "text": "I have down voted this video because I think you should have commented the previously explained code.

Execution Phase. \n\nAt the creation phase our code is scanned and ALL variables (used with the 'var' keyword) and function declarations gets stored in memory. Variable names are given space in memory and are given the default value of 'undefined' and the whole function declaration block also gets placed into memory. Then during the execution phase, these variables and functions are already available to the JS engine, which is why you can call a function before it's declared, because that call will 'point' to the function within memory.
