I found out later that if I rejected the certificate offer, the very next page would offer me the certificate 10% CHEAPER. Seems like a punishment for people who pay right away, which seems like a very opposite reward.\r\n\r\nWork submission problems:\r\n- During the course, ALL submissions were ONLY accepted via github. The software they provide you to aide in this ONLY works with Linux or on a MAC. I had to spent a full working day to learn github just to submit my work to them. This was not mentioned prior to taking the course.\r\n- When I submit my work, if there is a problem, I cannot make edits, I have to re-submit the entire form all over again. If there is a further problem, again, I have to write everything out again. No edit button?\r\n- Part of the requirement of work submission involves making a screen cast of 5 minutes demoing your software. I had to spend another day learning and installing OBS. I also had to buy a microphone. None of these requirements were mentioned prior to taking the course.\r\n- I took one assignment per week. However, work is graded in batches once every, say, 2-4 weeks. It's random. So I submitted 4 assignments by the time it took them to grade all 4. ALL FOUR had problems, which meant I had to fill out the form FOUR TIMES to correct the mistakes again.\r\n- For the 5 minute demo video, well, I wanted to show my YouTube subs my software, so I made a 10 minute video. I clearly stated at the start of the video and in the submission (\"Just watch the first 5 minutes, the first 5 minutes cover everything you ask for\"). They reject my submission because \"Specification imposes a 5-minute limit length on videos.\". This is just laziness!\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this course or body to anybody. Sorry.
