{"video": {"id": "vXJpOHz3_sY", "title": "The All Powerful Front End Developer - Chris Coyier", "description": "The internet is, without metaphor, just a bunch of servers tied together with wires. Without servers, we'd have no way to share our creations with the world.\n\nYet, in a bit of a paradox, servers are less essential to our work than they've ever been. We can now do things on the front-end that used to require a back end. When we do need a back end, our front-end skills can be put to work, giving us some surprisingly powerful new abilities. Join Chris on a whirlwind tour of the tools, tech, and code that puts more power than ever into our front-end hands.\n\nTalk by Chris Coyier. Recorded at JAMstack Conf 2018 in San Francisco.
