And let's say we are happy with 10 minute blocks. But now suddenly, 450 new miners join the network. The computing power has increased to ten times it's original size and they would be able to find a block in 1 minute. But due to our original network design we don't want that, we want 10 minute blocks. So now we make it more difficult to find a block, by changing 4 required zeros to 5 required zeros. And obviously you have to do more computation to find a hash with 5 starting zeros than 4 starting zeros. That maintains our average time between blocks regardless of the network computer power.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxTgrewwxdKJ3pZM6J4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-31T11:02:34Z", "author": "Crazy ZYX", "text": ".75x is too slow & normal is too fast for me \ud83d\ude10", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxvPgP7CRjdrIFdNkF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-30T16:25:24Z", "author": "Oye Victor", "text": "Thank you so much", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyyhBJiBFzcyHQPz9x4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-30T15:32:20Z", "author": "Arnav Hazra", "text": "Thanks undercover Jeff Bezos!\n.\n.\nJokes aside, I appreciate you for taking the time to make this.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwto7EIDIzMMSegfcF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-29T13:09:24Z", "author": "G.A", "text": "storage factory does not finish compiling", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxAxVtzSren5RgSxad4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-28T00:55:12Z", "author": "Sakthivel Saravanan", "text": "I couldn't install brownie :(", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyzr361qXnaUMzsAWZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-23T18:46:12Z", "author": "P\u00e1ll Konr\u00e1d Filip", "text": "Hey guys.

Unless you can read the future, everytime you put money in a stock you risk it, and if it fails you can lose it.\nPlus, studies show that people rarely ever beat the index, and if they do it usually isn't long. (We'll use the one Warren Buffet did as a source, but there are many) Sure, there are people who get rich doing this, but it's always a gamble. \n\nI forget if it's 90% or 95%, but casinos pay out a large portion of what's gambled, but most of that money goes to only a few, and oftentimes they gamble it away again. That doesn't make casino's an investment.\n\nNow, the stocks you'd need to pull this off make it possibly worse, unless you got some insider knowledge I'm missing. The stable stocks like Apple, Google, and Microsoft aren't going to jump high enough to make this work. You'd be looking at les stabe stocks to pull this off. (Investing rule of thumb: Higher Risk = Higher Reward) With stocks, the risk is on things you can't control, (If you can control the stock you're investing in, there's a lot of laws being broken) so going high-risk is usually more problematic than it's worth, unless properly diversified. (Diversification also lowers return rates as well as loss. Hence why it's better to just go with an index fund than single stocks)\n\nAt the end of the day, can this work for you, possibly.

However, I am finding mine is moving much slower at 5.86s and everything else has also been slower in brownie. I was curious if this was just caused by things such as too many tabs open (youtube, notes, VS etc.), my computer and hardware, etc. or if there was something within my VS setup that was slowing me down?
