(We'll use the one Warren Buffet did as a source, but there are many) Sure, there are people who get rich doing this, but it's always a gamble. \n\nI forget if it's 90% or 95%, but casinos pay out a large portion of what's gambled, but most of that money goes to only a few, and oftentimes they gamble it away again. That doesn't make casino's an investment.\n\nNow, the stocks you'd need to pull this off make it possibly worse, unless you got some insider knowledge I'm missing. The stable stocks like Apple, Google, and Microsoft aren't going to jump high enough to make this work. You'd be looking at les stabe stocks to pull this off. (Investing rule of thumb: Higher Risk = Higher Reward) With stocks, the risk is on things you can't control, (If you can control the stock you're investing in, there's a lot of laws being broken) so going high-risk is usually more problematic than it's worth, unless properly diversified. (Diversification also lowers return rates as well as loss. Hence why it's better to just go with an index fund than single stocks)\n\nAt the end of the day, can this work for you, possibly. Someone always wins the lottery, and some win it multiple times. Would I advise it, no.

But I have this observation. At 18:30: If your computer and backup computers go down, in regular world, your data is gone. At 19:20: All you need to access your data is a private key, essentially a password. So if you store/save your private key/password in your computer/backup computers and they all go down (no human will be able to memorize the private key), then although your data is sill somewhere, but it's no good because you can't access it anyway. So if the solution is to save the private key in some cloud-based password manager company, then the control is just shifted from a bank to a cloud password company.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Jonathan Joshua", "text": "lol just write it down and throw it into a safe", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Alessandro Speroni", "text": "I don't know what \"beginner\" word is referred to \ud83d\ude06", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "harsh shukla", "text": "hey Look Jeff Bezos with Hair :)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "India in Asia", "text": "I\u2019m super excited for this.
