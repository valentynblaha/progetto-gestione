There are:\n1.Voice-driven Interfaces\nVoice recognition technologies allow users to interact with the product without hands and eyes, focusing their attention elsewhere. Such technologies have already come a long way but are still far from perfect.\n2. Predictive Behavior Modeling\nHere are some examples of prediction behavior modeling: Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in mobile games, which can adapt a game to make it easier or harder based on a player\u2019s state (such as boredom or frustration), or an online store that sends emails with groups of goods that a person is just going to buy.\n3. Smart Data Transfer\nIn just a second, you can transfer images, videos, contacts, or even money with simple movements of the phone, using a compass, GPS, or hydraulic sensor.\nIf you want to learn more about innovative mobile app features, such as Converged Application Platform (CAP) or Native Advertising, I recommend you read this article: https://jetsoftpro.com/5-features-of-mobile-applications-which-will-change-the-market-jetsoftpro/", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Achmad Fariz", "text": "Excuse me ,i want to ask about minimum spesification laptop for become android deveploment", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Goku San", "text": "dude,  u explain stuff so much clearer and faster than my uni lecturers.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "arya mohammadi", "text": "pesian accent", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "matt boaston", "text": "how about IOS apps?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tanisha Shrivas", "text": "Can anybody pls help me if i should watch this course or code with Harry's ??", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Cesar Soltero", "text": "T H A N K \nY O U! \u2665", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Zzzzzzzjsjyue", "text": "16:50", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "SEENU", "text": "It was fun doing challenges in this videos, I have published My App on Playstore \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n** It was a greatful moment when i recieved 136$ with my app **", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Bc Bc", "text": "", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Javlon Tursunov", "text": "Bro  code suggestion is not working in my IDE like urs.

Esta dimens\u00e3o \u00e9 percebida principalmente na vida p\u00fablica de Jesus. O Evangelho de S\u00e3o Marcos come\u00e7a no deserto, da\u00ed seu s\u00edmbolo ser o le\u00e3o. Desde sua primeira viagem, tornou-se companheiro do ap\u00f3stolo Paulo. Marcos viveu em Roma por volta do ano 70, onde foi secret\u00e1rio e confidente de Pedro.  Portanto, seu Evangelho nos transmite a catequese do chefe dos Ap\u00f3stolos. Trata-se do mais curto dos Evangelhos, em estilo simples, vivo e pitoresco, rico em detalhes concretos.  Certamente Pedro conservara, de sua profiss\u00e3o de pescador, a aptid\u00e3o de observar! Jo\u00e3o Paulo II escolheu cinco momentos da vida de Cristo. O Batismo, no rio Jord\u00e3o, nos permite ouvir a voz do Pai que proclama Jesus seu Filho Bem Amado.  Em Can\u00e1, com seu primeiro milagre, Cristo abre o cora\u00e7\u00e3o dos Ap\u00f3stolos  ao mesmo tempo para a f\u00e9 e para a intercess\u00e3o de Maria. Quando Jesus anuncia a aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o do Reino de Deus, \u00e9 um chamado \u00e0 convers\u00e3o e assim inicia seu minist\u00e9rio da miseric\u00f3rdia. Na Transfigura\u00e7\u00e3o, Cristo resplandece na gl\u00f3ria de sua divindade e o Pai lhe d\u00e1 a conhecer aos Ap\u00f3stolos para que eles o sigam.

I think that's a preference. I have found that it is helpful if they are named the same because then you just know what view you are refering to. But again, totally not necessary for any code to work.\n2. The difference is that the name (grey) in your java file is the name you give to an object (in this case an object View. In the XML file you are giving your view (in this case the Edit Text) a name (purple), an id, to refer to it in your code. For example, think about it as if you were saving your friend's contact info on your phone. Your friend has a legal name (alex), and you can either save it on your phone like that or just use a petname like \"bestie\" or \"favorite\". In order to be able to call your friend easily, you will need to have their contact information saved on your phone, and it probably will help if you use their real name (alex), so then you don't get confused and don't remember what friend is it. But, regardless how you save it (alex or \"bestie\") it will work anyways as long as you save the right phone number correctly when creating the contact (  using findViewById((R.id.alex) in your java file Android, when creating the object View (with the name in grey). Now, separately from that, the use of giving a View an id is because you might want the view to do something. Going back to the same \"friend metaphor\", if you never need to call your friend, then you don't need to create their contact on your phone at all. Same with views! Some views won't need an id (the name in purple) if you don't need to do anything with them in your code. But if you need to do something with them such as make them trigger something to happen when clicked or collecting text from them, then they will need an id (name in purple).
