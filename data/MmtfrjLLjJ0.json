I'd like to start a project for next football season that's a weekly pick em site. I have a buddy who's a huge cowboys fan and I'd like to put some code in there that emits a loud buzz when he clicks on them to win, just to mess with his head haha.  I'd have to tie it to his login name somehow. Is that achievable with JS/jQuery?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UggLCxRr3CJecXgCoAEC", "publishedAt": "2017-08-01T06:28:48Z", "author": "Elregar71", "text": "I really enjoy your teaching style Beau, is there an order to watching your JavaScript vids?

So we can create classes / id's in CSS, for example .red{color: red;} and then use it to jQuery addClass, $(\"p\").addClass(red); without \"\". I had the same question while doing fcc-weather challenge. Suggestion, when you mentioned to use addClass, beginner won't understand what do you mean by CSS class as the class name is .red and the color is red and it is in CSS block which is hidden.

Question if we are not supposed to put production ready code in JS where do we put it and will it over ride the CSS code or is there a possibility that one will override the other?", "likes": 0}}]}
