If you're wondering what language is the best for you as the first language. Well, it really doesn't matter. Look I started with Java but I watched this tutorial in 1 hour instead of 5 just because I knew the basics of programming like variables loop, basic OOP and so on. Literally every language uses that. When you're a beginner your focus should not be to learn all the quirks of that language but rather to learn the basics,  the stuff that you meet in every language. After that, you can easily transfer to any language you want. Once you decide which one you want to stick with then it is time to learn the advanced stuff.

Especially, the mad&libs game tutorial was unrequired at all, since it didn't bring anything new - it was just another example of what you'd been talking about for the last 3 - 4 tutorials.

In the constructor they happen to be accessible since they are properties of the class itself so they are not run, that's what I think anyways I'd love to be corrected. But later on when an instance has been made and you start accessing/modifying the private properties __get and __set are run.\n\nSo you can drop the constructor and only choose to add or modify private properties on an instance of the class. Maybe it would be better if PHP knew that you were modifying a private property during construction and as such should run the __get or __set methods. But I might be missing something as this may be possible but I just don't know how to do it in this language.\n\nOr maybe that's a really bad idea, but I don't know.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mattias Aabmets", "text": "Your explanation is misleading @  1:21:00 .
