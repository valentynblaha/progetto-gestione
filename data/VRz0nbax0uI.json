In case of TWO or more occurrences of the same string/char in the inputString, it will tell index of only the first occurrence !\n\n\nlastIndexOf - same as indexOf() but returns the index of the LAST occurrence of the specified char or string in the input string.\n\nmatch - searches the input string for matches of the REGULAR EXPRESSION specified and returns them in an array.\n\nrepeat -  repeats the string a specified number of times, inputString.repeat(3) // 3 times repeat inputString !\n\nreplace - searches a string for a specific sub-string or REGULAR EXPRESSION and replaces it with the specified string. inputString.replace(\"end\", \"END\")\n\nsearch - searches the string for a specified sub-string or REGULAR EXPRESSION and tells it's position.\n\nslice - slices or extracts a specified portion of the inputString. inputString.slice(2,4), returns the stuff from index 2 till index 3\n\nsplit - splits the string, into an array of sub-strings, upon the occurrence of the character specified. e.g inputString.split(\" \") will split the string EVERYTIME a space (\" \") occurs in the inputString and push the character coming UP TILL the space as a new entry in the array. ( but not including the space itself ? )\n\nstartsWith - checks if a string begins with a specified character/sub-string; conditional check.\n\nsubstr - similar to slice, extracts a sub-string from the inputString, starting from the given initialIndex, and going up to the number of subsequentDigits, including the character at initialIndex in the count as well. inputString.substr(initialIndex, subsequentDigits) . Watch in video if it's hard to understand.\n\nsubstring - Ditto copy of slice, better to look at https://stackoverflow.com/a/2243835 for a better understanding of differences.\n\ntoLowerCase - makes ALL the letters in string to lower case\n\ntoUpperCase - exact opposite of toLowerCase() .\n\ntrim - removes WhiteSpace from EITHER SIDE of the inputString; inputString.trim().", "likes": 25}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxrgCEMtz3w8Hcb_7x4AaABAg.8md2VJYAuuw99uX7KywhlM", "publishedAt": "2020-06-15T01:46:34Z", "author": "Eli Lumilay", "text": "@Joon Kim did someone hurt your feelings boy?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxrgCEMtz3w8Hcb_7x4AaABAg.8md2VJYAuuw99u3wF2K44B", "publishedAt": "2020-06-14T21:31:31Z", "author": "Joon Kim", "text": "stop being lazy and f*ing spend 6minutes holy sh*t", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxrgCEMtz3w8Hcb_7x4AaABAg.8md2VJYAuuw96tReMxR16J", "publishedAt": "2020-04-01T02:05:22Z", "author": "Eli Lumilay", "text": "Dude you saved me.
