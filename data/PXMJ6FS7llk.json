It doesn't say \"Huge data extraction tutorial\". Now to counterpoint - VBA is niche and generally not useful language to learn, and it's \"Office-centric\". The point of the tutorial was to showcase Python's universality because of how many people know and currently learn the language. It's simply more popular and versatile. The argument about admin rights is also very irrelevant, since you used the Excel example - because whole Microsoft Office basically 'plagues' your system, along with Windows, so, no, you actually end up needing less software in the case of Python, since it doesn't restrict you with any specific system. You can also implement your own functions if you need them, which results in being sort of lightweight and not messy. Syntax is also simpler.\n\nOne point VBA has is the speed, it really is fast, but that doesn't mean it's gonna be suitable forever. VBA has no real future. It's not flexible. It's gonna die out because it clings onto Microsoft's support. Anything you can do in VBA can be done in Python. Literally anything. Also, Python's getting quicker and quicker, the times when it was slower than VBA, are long gone.\n\n \nWhy learn so many useless commands when you can just create them with a few clean simple lines of code that are very portable? With a great package manager,  good documentation and amazing community, VBA can't be compared to the future - which is Python.\n\nVBA is used only because of old habits. There is no other reason in 2022.\n\nAlso there are many more great languages other than Python, which are still better than the old VBA.", "likes": 3}, {"id": "UgyH2L-co6HnpqpFlKN4AaABAg.9cVZk3ei0aB9cVbpvjePfI", "publishedAt": "2022-06-20T15:58:03Z", "author": "ML", "text": "70% agreed", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzOl1ziKfb4SW9sLWN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-20T15:30:35Z", "author": "RFSNJN", "text": "what a perfect time, i just started python", "likes": 14}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzOl1ziKfb4SW9sLWN4AaABAg.9cVZgmAUmAn9cYJSa6HgS6", "publishedAt": "2022-06-21T17:06:26Z", "author": "Akram Bazina", "text": "Welcome to the club", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzOl1ziKfb4SW9sLWN4AaABAg.9cVZgmAUmAn9cYB5aAYdiV", "publishedAt": "2022-06-21T15:53:23Z", "author": "H", "text": "same here, really need this \ud83d\ude02", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzOl1ziKfb4SW9sLWN4AaABAg.9cVZgmAUmAn9cXVgZfWiC8", "publishedAt": "2022-06-21T09:34:05Z", "author": "dnyaneshwar53", "text": "Same here \u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzSTMV8btANd7HLyGp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-06-20T15:26:44Z", "author": "RENE RAMIREZ", "text": "THKS!!!!!
