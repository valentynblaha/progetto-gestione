Just finished today and I'm happy.\nA few things: \n1) I had to use a different API since the old one got somewhat shut down or whatever so I used Spoonacular instead. It was similar enough\n2) Used react Hooks instead of class components because I saw a video on hooks and wanted to try it out -> lots of useEffect and useState hooks\n3) Hardest part was understanding the equivalency between useEffect and componentDidMount/Update. If anyone is wondering how I got it working -> useEffect but empty dependencies list: [] == componentDidMount, then used a second useEffect hook for componentDidUpdate based on state.recipes as the dependency.  \nBoth will run on first go or when heading back to the main page but localstorage stays filled because once state.recipes is filled the first time, it'll just keep passing that data back and forth between state.recipes and localstorage so the main page data isnt lost. At least that's how I understood it.\n\nAnyway thanks again!", "likes": 5}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyjYeuBownrY_AyO854AaABAg.9RSi_Tlu95G9RoMMfb_g-X", "publishedAt": "2021-09-03T01:42:12Z", "author": "supergaljoy1994", "text": "@Baldstuck \nSo my main 2 useEffects look like this:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // console.log(\"mounted\");\n    //  handle previous state\n    const json = localStorage.getItem(\"recipes\"); //happens before local storage is cleared\n    const savedRecipes = JSON.parse(json);\n    setState({recipes: savedRecipes}); // -> triggers the second useEffect hook\n  }, []) // no dependencies the equivalent of component did mount (runs once at initialization)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    //handle saving current state\n    const returnedRecipes = JSON.stringify(state.recipes);\n    localStorage.setItem(\"recipes\", returnedRecipes); \n    // this will stick when looking at indiv recipes\n    // and, effectively, local storage doesnt get cleared -> constantly reapplied with state\n\n    // console.log(\"updating\");\n  },[state.recipes]); //both mounts and updates based on state (refresh or new page). \n\nSo from how I understand useEffect with or without a dependency list [] or [state.recipes] useEffect is similar to componentDidMount in that it will always run when the component is used. However with a dependency list, it gains the added effect of componentDidUpdate when the state (data variable to watch) gets updated. \nI figured this method might work because localStorage was able to persist with data when I switched to a page for an individual recipe even though at that point the state updated. The first useEffect hook would come into play when that individual recipe would show and reset the state to whatever localStorage was holding.\nWhen going back to the main page localStorage would get cleared, but since the first useEffect hook saved the state, the second useEffect hook can reuse that state and set it back into localStorage.", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgyjYeuBownrY_AyO854AaABAg.9RSi_Tlu95G9Ro7w6SQbkK", "publishedAt": "2021-09-02T23:36:05Z", "author": "Baldstuck", "text": "Could you explain or share more  about 3.
