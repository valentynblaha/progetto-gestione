However, there are some reasons as to why they're popular in some cases. Of course, developing for Apple owned platforms is a case. But aside from that, they are also extremely popular in generally successful businesses that can afford macs for their employees. People get macs in this case because they offer a middleground between the other two options - Windows and GNU/Linux: Windows is inconvinient af for development and linux distros generally lack an unified set of competent tools already set up for their users. \n\nThat being said, Apple isn't your friend and there are many limitations to their platforms. For instance, I'm into graphics programming and gamedev and Apple is downright hostile to the tools and apis I'm supposed to work with. This is why gaming in mac is practically dead and without a bright future.", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgxDjIrsI0g39TfZGhx4AaABAg.9YEewdXOe0R9YElRFllpfS", "publishedAt": "2022-02-09T20:17:52Z", "author": "Vs Sm", "text": "You don't, but it definitely makes your life easier and nicer.

None of these people are experts in sociology or economics - and they have less of an incentive to convey in their answers ideas like people getting paid less for more work than the '80s, or how the process of automating all jobs possible has been in the making for a long time. What I truly find unfortunate is how platforms like freecodecamp operate in a manner that's completely devoid of any real life context. They never ask people to unionize, they never talk about all the cons of working in tech, they never talk about how to detect if you're being exploited or paid less than you should be, and so on. Freecdecamp has this weird aura of toxic opositivity and we're here taking a sip of it just to cope with the harsh reality where we know deep down that learning some cool new technology is barely enough to find some stability is our lives.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyIv3YHSi9WF5MUc5F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-09T18:13:26Z", "author": "Marius Espejo", "text": "Awesome to see the variety of perspectives!
