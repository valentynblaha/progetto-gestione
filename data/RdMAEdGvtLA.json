You can not use VALUE clause in a FD declaration because the FD is working inside the I/O AREA, so if the compiler rejects it or not, it does not make any sense because for the next record in the block the initial VALUES are not defined.\nIn the case of printing the different types of lines must be defined with all values needed inside the WS Section and the FD 01 level is just a container where the  WS lines are moved as needed.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "RegiiPad", "text": "The title of this video is misleading since it doesn\u2019t show the development using vsCode, in fact shows too little about cobol itself and the workflow to develop a program.
