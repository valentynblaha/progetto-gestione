In this video, I will be showing how to implement breadth-first search traversal algorithm in JavaScript.\n \nThe algorithm starts at one node, first visits all its neighbors that are one edge away, then goes on to visiting each of their neighbors. The point is to determine how close nodes are to a root node.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Code: https://codepen.io/beaucarnes/pen/XgrXvw?editors=0012\n\n\ud83d\udc26 Beau Carnes on Twitter: https://twitter.com/carnesbeau\n\n\u2b50JavaScript Tutorials Playlists\u2b50\n\u25b6JavaScript Basics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbk2qRZtWSzCIN38JC_NdhW5\n\u25b6Data Structures and Algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkso-IbgiiP48n-O-JQA9PJ\n\u25b6Design Patterns: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnZtkAI3BqcYxKnfWn_C704\n\u25b6ES6: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbljtmmeS0c-CEl2LdE-eR_F\n\u25b6Clean Code: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkK24EaPurzMq0-kw5U9pJh\n\n-\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on technology: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new programming videos every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp", "duration": "PT6M11S", "likes": "532", "views": "47240"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy3rTKTw83RrpVrApN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-11-15T12:25:19Z", "author": "JorDANStew", "text": "What do you smell.
