I want a drop down menu of objects to select from that I can drag and drop onto a window and position them by use of the mouse, not a text written grid program.  This is going 20 years backwards to the days of DOS.  Are you kidding me?  Can you imagine the money spent by a company paying programmers to write a grid system for every window in an app?  WTH?\nAre you saying that no one has written a class object that will attach to a Python menu that allows one to simply drag and drop all the visual items one might have on a window: buttons, text boxes, labels, drop downs, etc?

I am absolutely new to this computer language but I\u2019m no novice to software development generally.  To me it\u2019s all about learning the syntax and basic commands build into the Python language, using pip and installing modules.\n\nI realize that this is a beginner\u2019s course, and you probably want to keep things simple. However, there are some things I don\u2019t understand.\n\nI\u2019ve just been through the \u201cBuild an Image Viewer App\u201d section and at some point, I noticed that the image_list was not defined as global inside the function where it was referenced along with the label and buttons, but the program was still working?\n\nI then tried to remove all other global definitions and still have a fully working program without any errors nor warnings from the compiler\u2026? (I\u2019m using PyCharm as development system)\n\nSeveral times during this section of the video you seems to get lost in the index parameter for the image list and imho its due to the complexity of the code. E.g., why the constant redefinition of the buttons and (unnecessary) parameter transfer? The program is already build using global parameters so why not use and maintain a global index parameter for the list instead?\n\nMy humble rewrite of the image viewer program below.

It takes extreme maturity and love for your audience to do what he is doing here without explicitly calling out what he is doing.  He is purposely making mistakes, the same type of mistakes a beginning programmer might make or even an experience programmer might make to teach audience how we as humans learn how to learn.  When we see him making mistakes it makes us think, when we see him making the mistake, why is he doing that, it is wrong, but to know that it is wrong, forces you to think about what he is doing and why he is doing it.  For those who do not catch that he is making a mistake, until he shows you that code does not work, he goes through the logic and thinking that help you to learn how to think and do programming when you stumble on a mistake and must think about how to correct your mistake when you have no one there to help you.   I have seen so many comments about they love the patience and clarity of how he teaches, but just wish he was professional enough to have thought thinks through so that we would just see clean examples where everything works out perfectly right.........but that is not how life and learning works.   Working through his errors and understanding how and why he corrected them, gives me different ideas, on how I could have done things differently and gives me more incentive and investment in the learning, because as we move through training, i am not just trying to remember what is being taught, I am learning how to learn and how to problem solve in real time.

Trying to guess what's going on, it checks the box.\nLater on, when you click the button, it still packs a new label with the content of the `var` variable. The later being the void string, it prints... a void string... so nothing but with the defaut height of a Label.\nIf you decide to uncheck the button manually, `var` is set to the off value and everything goes back to normal.\n\nMy solution to fix this, instead of using the deselect() function :\nIn the beginning, set the `var` variable to either the offvalue or the onvalue. It looks like :\n\nvar = StringVar()\nvar.set( <either your onvalue or offvalue> )\n\nThis way tkinter is not faced with a variable with an unknown value, and everything should be fine (and the code is clearer to me)\n\n\nBONUS : 'from' is a python keyword, and thus can't be used as a name for a variable.

You'd have to check for <expr1> <op> <expr2> ...<expr_n/op_n> and evaluate, whether the character-sequence of the expressions represent a purely numerical value to make the operation legal and also evaluate legal operators. You could use an ASCII-table for that because you already read your input in as a string, so you'd only have to iterate over it, check until you reach a character that represents an operator, and then check the left expression of the operator to be a valid number, if true, you check the right expression of the operator to be a number (in case of div: right operand != 0), if true, you execute the operation you found. This could be done in an evaluation-function, which depending on the case (switch(op), cases add, sub, mul, div) returns you the right result. A step further would be to evaluate a calculation with arbitrary length inputs of expressions and operators.

However, this is incorrect and probably just overlooked due to the recording happening etc. The if statement needs to be placed before the buttons as it will determine the state in which the buttons will be in. Once they are placed on the gui, the state can be changed but the button would have the removed and replaced. Similarly, we cannot place the if statement prior to us incrementing the image_number variable. The reason we cannot do this is because if we increment after the if statement is executed, then we will be able to use our button past our final point and encounter an error. At this point, the button is broken and will just keep producing errors in your terminal or console window.

This tutorial seems to be good if you want to get an overview of the different widgets, but I have a suggestion for anyone who is following along: try to reuse functions instead of copying code and defining functions that do basically the same as the copied one. E. g. the calculator has four different functions that are basically the same with a different string saved in a global variable. You could pass the string as a parameter like you did with the number function, then you would only need one. The image viewer also has redundant code. You could call the same funktion for forward and backward, just put both if statements in.", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzCK9b61W0JN6Q4cBJ4AaABAg.9L8PHiZZpMC9SCU2N90iFC", "publishedAt": "2021-09-12T19:50:20Z", "author": "x0kosmus0x", "text": "@Aaron Holder  The more general function for all 4 operations could look like this\n\ndef button_opt(opt)\n   first_number = e.get()\n   global f_num\n   global math\n   math = opt\n   f_num = int(first_number)\n   e.delete(0,END)\n   \nAnd then you could call it like this\n\nbutton_add = Button(root, text=\"+\", podx=39, pody=20, command=lambda button_opt(\"addition\"))\nbutton_subtract = Button(root, text=\"-\", podx=39, pody=20, command=lambda button_opt(\"subtraction\"))\nbutton_multiply = Button(root, text=\"*\", podx=39, pody=20, command=lambda button_opt(\"multiplication\"))\nbutton_divide = Button(root, text=\"/\", podx=39, pody=20, command=lambda button_opt(\"division\"))\n\nthe rest can stay the same and you save 21 lines of redundent code.\n\nFor a dynamic image viewer you could use os.listdir to get all files in a directory.

You can just have the label select from you image list using image= image_list[x], then have the buttons increase or decrease the global variable x to have them move up or down the list by having the buttons set x= x+1, or -1 for backwards. to have them loop, just put that in an if function \"if x>3: x=x+1\" plus \"if x ==3: x=0\" for forwards, and use -3 for backwards. you can even have that update automatically if you define a variable that is always equal to the length of your image list using index()... I'm a beginner, big time, but when I saw you doing this is hurt me to think about and then did this with half the lines and less mind spinning. final code was like 100 characters and several lines shorter, and didn't even need an argument from the button commands or to global the buttons themselves inside their own commands so you don't run into weird redefine errors later.", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzEnE2zWbRkK5IBp4h4AaABAg.9HWwrrFO0jh9HWxJ5-RrO9", "publishedAt": "2020-12-21T08:54:14Z", "author": "David Todd", "text": "also, instead of redefining to change options, can you just use the .config() to change the parameters?", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxClAAAHnAd57Vgxzt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-20T13:21:49Z", "author": "Miky S", "text": "great !  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude42", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyFamV3yKEoWelDImZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-20T02:51:35Z", "author": "Jacob Crihfield", "text": "How did you make the title bar turn dark grey???", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzfMnijxrExhS2_wYp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-18T11:22:01Z", "author": "Jotaro", "text": "01:23:44", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzdlVEO59479pFaTqp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-17T14:04:27Z", "author": "Ana Beatriz", "text": "About Message Boxes topic:\nfrom Tkinter import messagebox\nImportError: cannot import name messagebox\nAnyone can help me?

For instance, if I move the slider to \"250\", click the button, it will display \"250\" in the label, but then if I move the slider back down to \"7\" and click the button, it will show \"270\" in the label. To fix this, I decided to try padding each side of the str() value I got back from horizontal.get() with two spaces and I found that this corrected the problem.
