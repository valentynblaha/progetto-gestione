It takes extreme maturity and love for your audience to do what he is doing here without explicitly calling out what he is doing.  He is purposely making mistakes, the same type of mistakes a beginning programmer might make or even an experience programmer might make to teach audience how we as humans learn how to learn.  When we see him making mistakes it makes us think, when we see him making the mistake, why is he doing that, it is wrong, but to know that it is wrong, forces you to think about what he is doing and why he is doing it.  For those who do not catch that he is making a mistake, until he shows you that code does not work, he goes through the logic and thinking that help you to learn how to think and do programming when you stumble on a mistake and must think about how to correct your mistake when you have no one there to help you.   I have seen so many comments about they love the patience and clarity of how he teaches, but just wish he was professional enough to have thought thinks through so that we would just see clean examples where everything works out perfectly right.........but that is not how life and learning works.   Working through his errors and understanding how and why he corrected them, gives me different ideas, on how I could have done things differently and gives me more incentive and investment in the learning, because as we move through training, i am not just trying to remember what is being taught, I am learning how to learn and how to problem solve in real time.   I call this love, because if he tells us that he is doing this on purpose, it does not have the same affect, if we think he is just like us, stumbling through things as he goes, he feels more relatable and we feel like we are learning right along with a real human being who is fallible like us and makes us, rather me more motivated to learn what he is teaching the way he is teaching it, making me feel confident because if he is making these types of mistakes and he is an expert, there must be hope for me!!!!

It is simply too fast and too distracting for me.

Trying to guess what's going on, it checks the box.\nLater on, when you click the button, it still packs a new label with the content of the `var` variable. The later being the void string, it prints... a void string... so nothing but with the defaut height of a Label.\nIf you decide to uncheck the button manually, `var` is set to the off value and everything goes back to normal.\n\nMy solution to fix this, instead of using the deselect() function :\nIn the beginning, set the `var` variable to either the offvalue or the onvalue. It looks like :\n\nvar = StringVar()\nvar.set( <either your onvalue or offvalue> )\n\nThis way tkinter is not faced with a variable with an unknown value, and everything should be fine (and the code is clearer to me)\n\n\nBONUS : 'from' is a python keyword, and thus can't be used as a name for a variable.

You'd have to check for <expr1> <op> <expr2> ...<expr_n/op_n> and evaluate, whether the character-sequence of the expressions represent a purely numerical value to make the operation legal and also evaluate legal operators. You could use an ASCII-table for that because you already read your input in as a string, so you'd only have to iterate over it, check until you reach a character that represents an operator, and then check the left expression of the operator to be a valid number, if true, you check the right expression of the operator to be a number (in case of div: right operand != 0), if true, you execute the operation you found. This could be done in an evaluation-function, which depending on the case (switch(op), cases add, sub, mul, div) returns you the right result. A step further would be to evaluate a calculation with arbitrary length inputs of expressions and operators.

Once they are placed on the gui, the state can be changed but the button would have the removed and replaced. Similarly, we cannot place the if statement prior to us incrementing the image_number variable. The reason we cannot do this is because if we increment after the if statement is executed, then we will be able to use our button past our final point and encounter an error. At this point, the button is broken and will just keep producing errors in your terminal or console window.

E. g. the calculator has four different functions that are basically the same with a different string saved in a global variable.

You can just have the label select from you image list using image= image_list[x], then have the buttons increase or decrease the global variable x to have them move up or down the list by having the buttons set x= x+1, or -1 for backwards. to have them loop, just put that in an if function \"if x>3: x=x+1\" plus \"if x ==3: x=0\" for forwards, and use -3 for backwards. you can even have that update automatically if you define a variable that is always equal to the length of your image list using index()... I'm a beginner, big time, but when I saw you doing this is hurt me to think about and then did this with half the lines and less mind spinning. final code was like 100 characters and several lines shorter, and didn't even need an argument from the button commands or to global the buttons themselves inside their own commands so you don't run into weird redefine errors later.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "David Todd", "text": "also, instead of redefining to change options, can you just use the .config() to change the parameters?", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Miky S", "text": "great !  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude42", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jacob Crihfield", "text": "How did you make the title bar turn dark grey???", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jotaro", "text": "01:23:44", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ana Beatriz", "text": "About Message Boxes topic:\nfrom Tkinter import messagebox\nImportError: cannot import name messagebox\nAnyone can help me?

This way, your program doesn't need to remember anything, and can just read what's in the Entry field when the equal button is pressed, and use eval(expresion_as_a_str) to evaluate the whole function easily. \nI'd also recommend making a function to create all the buttons so that you don't need to copy basically the same line a bunch of times only to change the value and placement of the button.\nUsing partials (from functools import partial, then command=partial(myFunction, argument)) is also a helpful way to pass arguments to the button commands.\nWith all this, the calculator project becomes a lot shorter to code and has all the same functionality.

When I use standard Python v3.7.x, the program terminates and its window disappears; but with Thonny, the window still remains on screen, and the program appears to continue to work. So, I assume this is a Thonny issue, and see what they recommend to terminate a running program. Other than this, your demo program works pretty well on Thonny.

The reason you need to have var here is that the radiobutton calls the command including the currently selected radiobuttons value which you could process in the function.\n2) With the database example you added the connect, cursor, commit, close calls to each function, again with the 'just do it' words.  The reason you have to do this is because your conn.close() statement is before the root.mainloop() call so the database is being closed before the functions have a chance to be called.  If you move the conn.close() after root.mainloop() then when you call the functions the database is still open and you don't have to reopen and close the database each time.\n\n\nAs a teacher, you really should know why you are doing something, as those you teach will learn to do things by rote and not learn to understand how something is really working.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Early Castle", "text": "1:18:52 no.
