Luckily, with CSS, you can bend it to your will, or just straight up give it the Vulcan Death Grip.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will create IE Conditional Comments. Only IE will recognize this comment, which means you can do anything to manipulate the CSS specifically for IE!\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fFiles you need \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udcbbInternet Explorer Hacks Code: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qp15sn3jngeun1x/AACcoyR63yTMFw9NqS93aGUCa?dl=0\n\ud83d\udcbbAll tutorials in this series need this \"_theme-styles\" directory (only download once): https://www.dropbox.com/sh/890hx6ke34oovaz/AAByJ-jb-H5pWuIUx7t_GvQqa?dl=0\n\nThis video works as a stand-alone tutorial but is also day 11 of CSS3 in 30 Days.

I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \n\nIt is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \n\nThe weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called \u201cFischer Random Chess,\u201d where the starting position of the pieces is \u201crandomized\u201d to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\n\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\n\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0\n\nBIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\n\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \n\nThanks and God bless!\n \nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Arjit Sharma", "text": "Finally IE is dead. :/", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Slimer", "text": "Please help, when ever i use the code with the - - it doesn't work and when i remove them it does work but ruins how other browsers look, idk whats the problem!? here's the code\n\n\n<!--[if IE]>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n   .footer{\r\n text-align: center;\r\n color:white;\r\n font-size: 11px;\r\n  top: 50%;\r\n   left: 50%;\r\n   /* bring your own prefixes */\r\n   transform: translate(-0%, -55%);\r\n  }\r\n  .span{\r\n -webkit-user-select: none; /* Safari */        \r\n-moz-user-select: none; /* Firefox */\r\n-ms-user-select: none; /* IE10+/Edge */\r\nuser-select: none; /* Standard */\r\nmargin-right: -3.5px;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n<![endif]-->", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Deepak Surya", "text": "The files don't contain any of the code that you're showing bro", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "John Jay", "text": "I must be missing something.  ie.css supplied in dropbox is not the same file you have shown on screen.
