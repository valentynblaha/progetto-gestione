We will learn how to deploy and run models along with full deep learning applications in the browser! To implement this cool capability, we\u2019ll be using TensorFlow.js (TFJS), TensorFlow\u2019s JavaScript library.\n\nBy the end of this video tutorial, you will have built and deployed a web application that runs a neural network in the browser to classify images! To get there, we'll learn about client-server deep learning architectures, converting Keras models to TFJS models, serving models with Node.js, tensor operations, and more!\n\nThis course was created by deeplizard.
