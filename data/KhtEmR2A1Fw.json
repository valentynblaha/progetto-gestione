I needed some advise towards my career and getting better at JavaScript. Okay, so I'm a junior freelance front-end developer & UX/UI Designer. I'm trying to get better at JavaScript and really nail the core with building projects/games/hackerrank.com exercises.\n\nWhat I'm doing now is: freelance work to gain experience and pay bills, game development to get better at JavaScript logic, and enhancing my math skills also to get better at logic.\n\nShould I not be creating games and just be completing hacker rank exercises to get better at logic?\n\nAlso, React is really big now but I'm not able to get enough work done for freelance or other tasks if I try and fit in React - plus I feel getting great at core JavaScript is important too so thats why don't want to give up logic development through games or hacker rank.\n\nMaybe I can just build more client sites for two months and while I do I can continue to build games/hackerrank.com to improve my logic. And after two months I learn react?\n\nConfusing for sure.\n\nAny advise?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Paras Jain", "text": "Hey, you have an excellent question. It would have been better if someone advised you 5 years ago. Hope you have grown a lot. I am a junior developer and I like javascript but don't really know how to grow. The project I am currently in offers almost zero learning. Logic wise I think I am okay but would like to build more and I am a bit skeptical about React, if you have any advise, it would be very helpful.
