Prototyping is a way to do exactly this. When we design our websites, we progress from wireframing, prototyping, and finally, a full design. In this tutorial you will learn what Prototyping actually means and what it looks like. You will see the full process of taking an early prototype and wireframe and creating a website.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Video from Adrian Twarog.
