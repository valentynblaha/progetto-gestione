As you live in an Agile world today, how do you use architecture disciplines like Kruchten 4+1, UML, TOGAF, and Zachman? What do they mean? Where do you start?\n\nIn this talk, Brad Beiermann will take you on a journey through the past, present and future disciplines of being a software architect. This talk will equip you with the concepts of continuous design, and what it means to be design driven in today's fast paced development environment. \n\n\ud83d\udd17Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/BradBeiermann/the-language-of-application-architecture\n\nTalk by Brad Beiermann at the July, 17, 2018 meeting of Software Craftsmanship McHenry County.
