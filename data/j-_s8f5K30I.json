This is not a good place to start if you do not already have some programming experience. A suggested pre-requisite is Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody course: https://youtu.be/8DvywoWv6fI\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Online C Programming book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie: https://www.cc4e.com/book/chap00.md\n\ud83d\udd17 Additional course resources: https://www.cc4e.com/\n(Unlock Code Hint: View the developer console on the website.)\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Dr. Charles Severance developed this course.
