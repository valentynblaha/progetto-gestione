There is Coding Addict aka John Smilga who does html/CSS/js separately.  There are rumours that Codeholic wants to make PHP course which is great! Would you be able to look at Coding Phase? I know he is pretty expensive, but he does stuff differently and has very much job orientated approach which I think should be a standard.

Using tiled graphics saves thousands of kbytes. Put it this way: a full Gameboy screen is 8k. How many screens does the entire Pokemon map take up? Multiply that times 8k for the total memory needed, and I think you get a number much larger the available storage on a Gameboy. With tiles, you can have a bunch of very large maps without using very much storage. Tiled graphics amount to a very effective form of data compression. Otoh, I'm not discounting the appeal of their simplicity. Ijs, on consoles back in the early 90s, storage was incredibly limited. Pretty much every design decision was heavily influenced by that factor.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "DeepFriedOreo", "text": "@Greg Mark You're not wrong about the console limitations of showing a full image of the entire world. That doesn't sound very practical.\n\nI would not say tiles were used \"primarily\" to save memory though. Tiles, being data points in 2D arrays, are just a structured way of tracking space in games. Every single room in many text-based games are technically tiles, and the player's position in it's world is tracked using 2D arrays. It's just the most practical approach.\n\nIn terms of saving memory, that would be the way tile sets are utilized, which are the sprites.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Greg Mark", "text": "Back in the 90s, no game console had enough memory to display and scroll full-screen images of the map.
