{"video": {"id": "RdRMNT-98Oo", "title": "Why You Don't Need jQuery Anymore", "description": "jQuery was a wonderful tool that paved over the irregularities of browsers and offered a simple interface for making very powerful applications. Today with evergreen browsers and modern JavaScript, we no longer need this crutch. Let\u2019s look at our favorite jQuery techniques like $.ajax() and $(\u2026).click() and $(\u2026).addClass() and compare this to the code we\u2019d write in modern JavaScript. Sprinkled in are great ES6 techniques like rest and spread, promises and fetch. Challenge yourself on your next project to see if you can run in a post-jQuery world.\n\nNOTE: You still might want to learn jQuery because many companies still use it.

It was never that \"fat\". But even 4 years ago, the good thing was many websites used jQuery from its original websites, so it was cached in many cases. Today, jQuery is still alive and it's an insanely smaller problem - mainly because the library and framework issue has grown way bigger. I stopped using jQuery almost everywhere, but using the 90kB (compressed) version makes it reasonable in those rare instances where you really want the jQuery shortcuts.
