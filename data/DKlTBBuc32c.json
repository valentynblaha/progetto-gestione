Don't take me wrong, I like JS a lot, but right now when it comes to scalability, Java is still the way to go (it's expensive tho, since Java devs cost more but the bigger the system the more it's worth the money). Also I feel like maven is way better than NPM, I barely had problems with versions on it, while in node it feels like it's a beta tool, same problem with Python and pip, that's where Java shines, easier version handling, easier package handling, and less prone to errors that are out of reach, or maybe it's because I'm living a hell trying to work with Tensorflow and Tflearn on Python ...", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Inter Net", "text": "@Mindblow JS is faster most of the time, but it is also true that business do not use it for backends at least no big businesses. However there is a great possibility that the next JS will  some day just be a language which compiles to wasm same as AssemblyScript and then it runs on the same level like Java but this time faster for sure all the time. And regarding your error prone comment there is TypeScript and guess what it is used in big businesses also AssemblyScript uses the ts compiler and the goal is to be one day so close to normal TS that exactly this will happen what I have described earlier that one day it will be a TS syntax language which compiles directly to wasm, this can then run anywhere servers/browsers and every device you can imagine.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Mindblow", "text": "@Inter Net that's not true at all for complex backends, the more libraries you use with JS the slower it becomes, that's where Java keeps performance, reason why bigger companies don't use JS/Node backends.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Inter Net", "text": "@Mindblow i hope you know that JS in v8 is faster than JAVA", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Mindblow", "text": "@Inter Net what are you smooking man, doing the same with JS is more messy, this has form check with a few beans, in JS you have to do way more just to check the fields in the backend, also JS is way slower, and working with libraries and repos is hell, it's easy to use but man how it is prone to errors.\nDeveloping with JS is cheaper tho, you can hire junior programmers, hence the popularity.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Steffy", "text": "Can a total beginner follow along or is it mandatory to have any prerequisite knowledge of any tech stack used here or anything else to follow along the project...I know little bit of Angular.Any help regarding this would greatly helpful.\ud83d\ude4f", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Programming Techie", "text": "Hi you need to have fundamental understanding of Spring Boot to follow along the backend part, if there are any new annotations/ concepts which are beyond the scope of a beginner, I tried to explain it.
