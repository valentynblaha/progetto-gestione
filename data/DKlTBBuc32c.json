First just some bad things, there is already full support for JWTs with a customizable JWTFilter already in spring security. Also spring security comes with the JWT Nimbus library, so there is no need to include an extra JWT library. Implementing custom security (as a jwt filter) is ALWAYS a security risk.\n\nSecond of all something very bad, storing JWTs in local storage is a security risk. In case of en XSS all tokens can be stolen.

Also I feel like maven is way better than NPM, I barely had problems with versions on it, while in node it feels like it's a beta tool, same problem with Python and pip, that's where Java shines, easier version handling, easier package handling, and less prone to errors that are out of reach, or maybe it's because I'm living a hell trying to work with Tensorflow and Tflearn on Python ...", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgyA43kkYvr1JOzy_P14AaABAg.999YIu1cmSc9Kcnw2a5n0t", "publishedAt": "2021-03-08T14:21:11Z", "author": "Inter Net", "text": "@Mindblow JS is faster most of the time, but it is also true that business do not use it for backends at least no big businesses.
