Chandler III. Chandler was mentor of Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Robert Mueller, James Comey and John Podesta, to name but a few.\n\njames-p-chandlerChandler represented Leader Technologies, Inc. from the moment Leader realized their innovations were patentable in early 2000. But rather than file the patents immediately, Chandler suspiciously advised Leader to \u201creduce to practice\u201d the invention before he would file them.\n\nHindsight shows that Chandler gave that advice in order to steal the actual source code when it was ready. Chandler bamboozled Leader into taking custody of a copy of the source code in 2002 which he immediately gave to the IBM Eclipse Foundation which then disseminated it to Zuckerberg/Facebook and other companies.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgjFxGmOG2yKJHgCoAEC", "publishedAt": "2017-07-12T05:50:36Z", "author": "Preety Dubey", "text": "I want to create a image of that type in which image of library present many books if touch one book on them then open all the information about that book and also purchase from there...
