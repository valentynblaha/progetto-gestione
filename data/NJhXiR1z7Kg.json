The first letter of the first word is lowercase, along with the remainder of the word, but the first letter of every consecutive word is capitalized. There are no spaces. Examples: brianaLovesHerPets, bestFoodIsCheese, and codeIsWorthLearning. \n\nWhen you name variables, utilize camelCase. Also try to keep the names descriptive and short so that others (and yourself!) can tell what that variable is referring to just by the name.", "duration": "PT1M40S", "likes": "116", "views": "14852"}, "comments": []}
