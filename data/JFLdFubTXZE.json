Why? Because while regular bits are limited to only two boring values, QBITs can take near infinite values and operate singularly or in harmony with each other. This outstanding property gives rise to a new kind of algorithms (and a lot of fun!). Follow me on a journey from Zuses Z3 computer and Schr\u00f6dingers cat to supercooled quantum processors and parallel universes - no PhD in physics required.\n\nTalk given by Alasdair Collinson at the Voxxed Days Zurich 2018 conference.\n\n--\n\nThanks to Devoxx for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
