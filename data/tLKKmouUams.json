Python is my favourite programming language because it's intuitive. The only problem what I have with Python is that, at time we need to define the type of variable.\n3. I need to understand, can we get good code completion suggestion. VSCode seems to be just fine. What about PyCharm? It is by Intellij team, is it better than VSCode in this regard of code completion? I have been using Kite as well. I am not very impressed. TabNine doesn't work well with VSScode, though I have heard that it works good with sublime text. Nevertheless, I dont wanna start working for sublime text, just because of TabNine.
