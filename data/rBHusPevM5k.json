I think this has been a great intro to object-oriented programming for me, even if that was not the main topic. \nOne question:\nWhen you change game state, you call gStateMachine['**name_of_new_state**'](). This returns a now object of the appropriate class. My question is: what happens to the old state object? Is this not a memory leak? Every time you change state you create a new state object and the old one just hangs around. I suppose Lua probably has automatic memory management if its anything like Python. But it would be nice to clarify this. Certainly if this was C++ you would have to call the destructor for the previous state object.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx5j3nxfXUBNGQ3sZd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-21T11:47:54Z", "author": "C\u00f3digo de S\u00eanior", "text": "\u00ac _\u00ac", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxRdEjh_8kPOYvWvPB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-22T02:00:32Z", "author": "Roy Donk", "text": "The instructor really loves to use the word 'arbitrary'", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwAp4qpGynr7c1jOG54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-19T18:03:22Z", "author": "ItsKenPlayz", "text": "at first i thought there was no audience and he was talking to himself", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwAp4qpGynr7c1jOG54AaABAg.98qkS-hTnsH9EHyExT8Z_r", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01T23:39:37Z", "author": "Abu Al-Asif", "text": "Lmaoo", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxhZN_TRufk30IZzHp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-01T17:59:11Z", "author": "jason nnorce", "text": "When I download love it won\u2019t work", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxhZN_TRufk30IZzHp4AaABAg.987Oe_28heO9AxgEuozpsv", "publishedAt": "2020-07-11T03:44:06Z", "author": "Taha Mir", "text": "Download atom editor ,\nAnd love version 0.10.2", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgxhZN_TRufk30IZzHp4AaABAg.987Oe_28heO9Axg8dgcPLR", "publishedAt": "2020-07-11T03:43:14Z", "author": "Taha Mir", "text": "What issue you are having", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyOI6aN06Ba2vda-Qp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-02-15T17:23:32Z", "author": "Pig", "text": "Nice stuff!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxqLBJCuSICHEk9cGh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-19T15:33:49Z", "author": "CraftedGadgetMC", "text": "Great game engine that uses Lua is Defold", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyP-F6U_8vPvgYDn_V4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-13T20:55:47Z", "author": "aim4thekill", "text": "some one pls help me ? im getting this msg error attempt to index global 'love' (a nil value)\n\n\nocal background = love.graphics.newImage('background.png')\r\nlocal ground = love.graphics.newImage('ground.png')\r\n\r\nfunction love.load()\r\n    -- initialize our nearest-neighbor filter\r\n    love.graphics.setDefaultFilter('nearest', 'nearest')\r\n\r\n    -- app window title\r\n    love.window.setTitle('Fifty Bird')\r\n\r\n    -- initialize our virtual resolution\r\n    push:setupScreen(VIRTUAL_WIDTH, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT, WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, {\r\n        vsync = true,\r\n        fullscreen = false,\r\n        resizable = true\r\n    })\r\nend", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyP-F6U_8vPvgYDn_V4AaABAg.92VD_Z3mCIO9BAXQzdEZyq", "publishedAt": "2020-07-16T12:47:44Z", "author": "[GD] SirNishka", "text": "You wrote \n`ocal background = love.graphics.newImage('background.png\")\nwhen it should be\n`local background = love.graphics.newImage(background.png\")\nyou missed the l in locsl", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyP-F6U_8vPvgYDn_V4AaABAg.92VD_Z3mCIO98qkfvIJe7C", "publishedAt": "2020-05-19T18:05:24Z", "author": "ItsKenPlayz", "text": "i dont think you installed love 2D", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgyP-F6U_8vPvgYDn_V4AaABAg.92VD_Z3mCIO93kIUhdquAY", "publishedAt": "2020-01-13T23:17:55Z", "author": "kiwitoothpick", "text": "aim4thekill no idea I\u2019m a beginner \n\nlocal QuickPrint = print(\u201cI love cats I love games and I love cars\u201d)\n\nrun", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxTcVlDGeiOW3SPNQl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-30T21:54:24Z", "author": "Batterzer Rocket League", "text": "Why is it always this guy", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzPxbEYcf9LndlfrCB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-03-04T13:00:01Z", "author": "StarB\u00f3tica", "text": "I am not only watching the videos but also doing the homework.
