You often don't need code comments if make more things into descriptive little functions. Same with the file structure, these intro classes assume it makes it easier to keep things \"simple\" by having a huge main file and everything in the src folder, but I think most people can handle the file navigation, and it would show much better how to have clean, readable, and maintainable code", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Weed Wanker", "text": "wow this is really high production value", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Hu\u1ef3nh", "text": "Flappy bird comes from Vietnam", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Imi\u0119 Nazwisko", "text": "The pipepairs update is very hard to grasp.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "MightyCole", "text": "Hey freeCodeCamp.org!

I think this has been a great intro to object-oriented programming for me, even if that was not the main topic. \nOne question:\nWhen you change game state, you call gStateMachine['**name_of_new_state**'](). This returns a now object of the appropriate class. My question is: what happens to the old state object? Is this not a memory leak? Every time you change state you create a new state object and the old one just hangs around. I suppose Lua probably has automatic memory management if its anything like Python. But it would be nice to clarify this. Certainly if this was C++ you would have to call the destructor for the previous state object.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "C\u00f3digo de S\u00eanior", "text": "\u00ac _\u00ac", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Roy Donk", "text": "The instructor really loves to use the word 'arbitrary'", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "ItsKenPlayz", "text": "at first i thought there was no audience and he was talking to himself", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"author": "Abu Al-Asif", "text": "Lmaoo", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "jason nnorce", "text": "When I download love it won\u2019t work", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Taha Mir", "text": "Download atom editor ,\nAnd love version 0.10.2", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Taha Mir", "text": "What issue you are having", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pig", "text": "Nice stuff!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "CraftedGadgetMC", "text": "Great game engine that uses Lua is Defold", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "aim4thekill", "text": "some one pls help me ? im getting this msg error attempt to index global 'love' (a nil value)\n\n\nocal background = love.graphics.newImage('background.png')\r\nlocal ground = love.graphics.newImage('ground.png')\r\n\r\nfunction love.load()\r\n    -- initialize our nearest-neighbor filter\r\n    love.graphics.setDefaultFilter('nearest', 'nearest')\r\n\r\n    -- app window title\r\n    love.window.setTitle('Fifty Bird')\r\n\r\n    -- initialize our virtual resolution\r\n    push:setupScreen(VIRTUAL_WIDTH, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT, WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, {\r\n        vsync = true,\r\n        fullscreen = false,\r\n        resizable = true\r\n    })\r\nend", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "[GD] SirNishka", "text": "You wrote \n`ocal background = love.graphics.newImage('background.png\")\nwhen it should be\n`local background = love.graphics.newImage(background.png\")\nyou missed the l in locsl", "likes": 0}, {"author": "ItsKenPlayz", "text": "i dont think you installed love 2D", "likes": 1}, {"author": "kiwitoothpick", "text": "aim4thekill no idea I\u2019m a beginner \n\nlocal QuickPrint = print(\u201cI love cats I love games and I love cars\u201d)\n\nrun", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Batterzer Rocket League", "text": "Why is it always this guy", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "StarB\u00f3tica", "text": "I am not only watching the videos but also doing the homework.
