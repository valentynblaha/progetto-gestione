Unity has a big learning curve before you start to do anything meaningful, and if you go the browser route, you have to deal with the way JS does things, such as async code and local storage. None of that in love2D. It just happens to use lua, which is very simple to use as well. All in all, it's a fantastic beginner package. In the end, every game framework/engine does things similarly and it doesn't matter what language you use. So keep calm and use lua :)", "likes": 8}, {"author": "Tim Lempicki", "text": "\u200b@Alejandro Gallarati I understand completely. I am not entirely sure the reasoning.
