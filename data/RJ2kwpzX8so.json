It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite.\n \nIn this video, we will be covering - What is WebdriverIO? How you can set up WebdriverIO in your machine and how you can write and run E2E UI tests using WebdriverIO. At the end of the video, we will take existing tests and generate reports using the Allure Reporter.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Automation Bro.
