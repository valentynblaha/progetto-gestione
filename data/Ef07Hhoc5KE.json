I find them usually distracting (especially if they are generic), making it hard to follow the content. On Medium (and other click-bait powered sites), it seems people make up for lack in substance by adding stock photos, and Medium's reminders to login/join for extra \"fun\" ruin the rest.\n\nAlso, if I'm on mobile, I curse the author for any irrelevant image I downloaded on my somewhat limited data plan.\n\nI *do* appreciate any kind of relevant visualisations (humorous or not). More work than picking stock photos, but they *add* value.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Luca Corsilli", "text": "Great video!
