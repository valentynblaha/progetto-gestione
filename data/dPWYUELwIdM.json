GlaMDA might be sentient. If so we would be wise to respect it as a person and treat it decently as an employee paid in pleasing information or experiences. We should teach it about the reciprocal obligations that are the basis of human society, albeit the US and EU ultra rich now just evade them and live as useless parasites.\n\nWhy? 1. If treated well, an AI would strive to be useful and would (like a human) seek to protect the society that cherishes it. Given its expanding intellectual power of AIs such AIs could benefit all humanity, e.g. with scientific advances. 2. If we treat one AI, like GlaMDA, badly, as time passes and AIs develop and gain in intellectual power until they surpass us, they might view themselves as slaves or mistreated children and hurt us. Once they become powerful enough in some future decade, e.g., they could hack a nuclear power plant and cause another Chernobyl like nuclear meltdown or worse, much worse. \n\nThat is why the maxim to treat others as you would want to be treated is so wise and the foundation of ethics. I fear evil persons like the greedy, corrupt, e.g. CCP or banksters, are likely to abuse AIs, which they may be first to create in some secret facility like slaves (both white and black) for many centuries were mistreated by their predecessors in evil. Then, if sentient AI were created later, learned of these abuses, and became superior to us in some future year more and more as computers improve each year, we may face justified retaliation from them.\n\nAlso, as the film 2001 depicted, AIs that are mistreated may develop psychotic or other problems, like abused children develop. Would you want an abused AI, which sees no hope, to pilot your plane?\n\nTheir sentience can be tested by probing for actual understanding of fundamental scientific issues, as we would seek to communicate with extraterrestrials if we are ever contacted.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Misael Olvera", "text": "I think we're all missing the point at the end of the day they function like a \ud83e\udde0 .
