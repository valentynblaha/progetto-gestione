I feel like statistics that are delivered through university platforms are usually quite messy and not very organized because, unlike calculus or engineering math subjects, statistics materials are very different from books to books and lectures to lectures.\n\nFor example for simple topics like regression, the way some lectures explain the formula are just nightmares. Without clear explanation some lectures decide to divide some values for convenience during calculation, or use confusing names like SS, RSS for the same thing and mix naming conventions for vector, and elements of vectors while traversing through them to calculate cost functions etc.\n\nStatistics is useful, no doubt about that, but with the way they are taught in many of universities, I also got to hate statistic subjects although I did have great interests in other math and physics subjects.", "likes": 8}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyJURZUn96kgsRTmu54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-11T16:52:49Z", "author": "Jiao Feng", "text": "very helpful", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyFFL7eBNcKu_KpQH54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-08T10:25:58Z", "author": "Kristen Chantelle", "text": "Hey, I know school is back and summer classes are hear with us meaning the essays and assignments are back.

You only want the middle 0.2000 (or 0.1000 on each side of the central line).\nThe area you do NOT want is the entire area (1) minus the area of interest (0.2000). Divide that by 2 so you can focus on the first half of the distribution. This way you obtain 0.4000.\nYou could obtain the exact same result by considering half of the whole area (1/2 = 0.5000) and subtracting 0.1000 from it.\n\nIn order words, 0.4000 represents the first part of the area that you do NOT want to consider. When you find the z-score for 0.4000 and convert it to x, you'll find the lower limit of your interval (the lower score that marks the middle 20% of the data). Below that limit lies the 40% that you do NOT want to consider.\nFor the upper limit, you can do the exact same thing on the other half of the area (in this case the z-score will be the opposite). Above that limit lies the 40% that you do NOT want to consider.\nIn between \n\nHope this helps!\n\nPS: I suggest you also have a look at her graph while going through this, I find it makes a lot more sense when you visualize things.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxr-Gx76K70pm7zmEN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-09T16:23:58Z", "author": "Anton \u00d6stlund", "text": "life saver! would have flunked out without this", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy7Lr0EALKvJB4VFcB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-05T06:08:42Z", "author": "Juan Villagomez", "text": "Who else is here to pass the linkedin tests", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwTd-x59-DaGNFgX_V4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-04T14:23:19Z", "author": "Sony Sony", "text": "Good", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxhPwZPGXJA4srcp854AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-04T14:09:37Z", "author": "Sony Sony", "text": "Good", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzjv_8qs028R-lWDhV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-02T21:12:01Z", "author": "Ferrell Linebarger", "text": "Proposition 69, nice", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzJUNDw87ouiMMoe714AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-01T18:18:41Z", "author": "Rogue Art", "text": "In chapter 7, it said that there will be stuff covered in chapter 8, but the video ends with chapter 7.
