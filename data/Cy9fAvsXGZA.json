In case this process is not running right now and it starts after few seconds,  Redis Stream will send whatever in the Stream (the old and new) to this microservice and the microservice will go through all of them again and you will end up having duplicates in your HASH table.\nYou should remove whatever was consumed from the Stream so in case of subscribing to it you don't get the whole stream again. \non the other hand, you can have multiple instances of the \"Consume\" process in case you have a lot of orders, each instance takes care of one order after another.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "shinobi", "text": "@goosh thanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "likes": 0}, {"author": "goosh", "text": "I like you're forward thinking ability \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pikachu", "text": "Internal request is a bad practice", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "North Patawee", "text": "Hi, I want to do this project but somehow I stuck at the Front-End part because I've used only Python.
