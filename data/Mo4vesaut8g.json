It's true that recursive algorithms *on trees* often have logarithmic performance, but it's just as easy to make a non-recursive  example and it's really not confusing to use iteration for tree algorithms rather than recursion also.  The point is: at each step of *iteration* or *recursion* is that you're *multiplying or dividing* instead of *adding*.\n* Why not just jump into merge sort for nlogn and use the separate example in addition?\n* I do like the fib explanation for 2^n.  What would have been *really* cool IMO is demonstrate how you can improve it.  Easy way: memoize that function to get O(N).  Slightly harder way but still possible with algebra: rewrite the fibonnacci definition in terms fib(n/2) instead of fib(n -1).  Write an iterative solution that is O(log(n)) for this!  This one example could illustrate both how to calculate different big Os, running the different solns on different input sizes can demostrate clearly how helpful this is.

Imagine a function like:\n\n    f(n):\n      var k = rand(n)\n      for(i = 0; i < k; i++) { print(i) } \n\nWhere rand(n) returns a random number between 0 and n-1.  It's possible that this will only loop zero times, if rand returns 0.  On average it will loop N/2 times.  But in the worst case it will loop N times, so we say it's O(N) instead of O(N/2). Now technically we can ignore constant factors in big O notation, so actually O(N) is the same as O(1/2 * N), but hopefully this gets the point across.\n\nYou don't need much math to calculate big O notation, but you do often need to understand how logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation, because logarithms often show up in algorithms on trees, which are kind of like exponential structures (each depth of a tree has exponentially more possible leaves than the previous depth).\n\nAlso, as someone with a CS degree - Big O isn't something you should have a full course on.  It's something that you should learn the basics of in CS-101, and then think about in every subsequent course you take, and really any time you're writing code that needs to be remotely optimized.  When I interview someone, I actually sometimes give them an example where N is known, which effectively makes it a constant.  This means that O(N^5) is actually the same as O(1) - and we shouldn't try too hard to optimize such a thing.", "likes": 3}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyXxVd2B89wUQsMljd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-31T05:33:23Z", "author": "ArleynH", "text": "This is a very nice explanation but the graphics are just horrendous", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzWXF4yZ7dV8RGa_Nd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-30T15:30:57Z", "author": "Pawan Bakle", "text": "Thankyou for this video!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzQThI0mTSFApouNCh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-28T16:39:09Z", "author": "Aishwarya Singh", "text": "Thank you for clearing the Big O notation concept in this video.

And the definition of n for the second example is that of a Geometric Mean of the arguments (a, b) for similar reasons. Can this be applied if a == b? \nYes, first example: n = a = b --> n = 0.5 * (n + n) = n. \nFor the second example, n = GM(a, b) = sqrt(a * b) = sqrt(n * n) = n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 So, as a more generic statement, time complexity for \n\n\u2728 N non-nested loops is O(n*N); where, n = AM(n1, n2, ..., nN) = (n1 + n2 + ... + nN) * (1/N)\n\u2728 N nested loops is O(n^N); where, n = GM(n1, n2, ..., nN) = (n1 * n2 * ... * nN) ^ (1/N)\n\nHere, n1, n2, ..., nN are the lengths of the N loops.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyqQSzEIeVleRVsT894AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T23:58:09Z", "author": "dreewhispers", "text": "honestly i live freecodecamp, i learned great deal of things on it, but this course is just so slow and boring, not sure if it's me or the course but it was hella boring", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzoDbVDukHZiazq-pF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T21:25:40Z", "author": "B B", "text": "Alot of good info here, but it's really overkill to spend so much video time explaining each iteration of a nested for loop n cubed, especially after spending so much time explaining each iteration of a nested for loop n squared.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw-lAJRRCYbOFdUuBd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T11:26:37Z", "author": "Valeriia Osypova", "text": "thank you! it is so much easier now", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyy29t76yAuCStMHAh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T08:17:49Z", "author": "Mintu Saren", "text": "Circle of zero.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzsSFKydF6910BCiDZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T07:45:30Z", "author": "Connmary Mark", "text": "The economy hardship, recession, unemployment and loss of job caused by covid pandemic is enough to push people into financial ventures.", "likes": 25}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzsSFKydF6910BCiDZ4AaABAg.9R0W279MKcE9R0jYlzgaFJ", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T09:52:18Z", "author": "SEWERYN SZULC", "text": "This woman has really changed the life of many people from different countries and I'm a testimony of her trading platform.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzsSFKydF6910BCiDZ4AaABAg.9R0W279MKcE9R0j47AAZOk", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T09:48:06Z", "author": "\ud835\ude76\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude8d\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude76\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e", "text": "@Evelyn HernandezThat's her official WhatsApp number \ud83d\udc46", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzsSFKydF6910BCiDZ4AaABAg.9R0W279MKcE9R0j2NJus2B", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T09:47:52Z", "author": "\ud835\ude76\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude8d\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude76\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e", "text": "+ \u2460  \u2461 \u2462 \u2460 \u2461 \u2465 \u2461 \u2468 \u2460 \u2464 \u2465", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzsSFKydF6910BCiDZ4AaABAg.9R0W279MKcE9R0j03-XHnp", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T09:47:33Z", "author": "\ud835\ude76\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude8d\ud835\ude9c \ud835\ude76\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e", "text": "@Evelyn Hernandez I met Mrs Mitchell two years ago first time at a conference held in Manchester,\nWe made exchange of contacts, you can reach her on her  business what'sApp contact.\nLet her know I referred you to her.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzsSFKydF6910BCiDZ4AaABAg.9R0W279MKcE9R0io4_fyYV", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T09:45:47Z", "author": "Evelyn Hernandez", "text": "Someone help out with her contact info, how can I reach out to this broker Mrs Mitchell Roland.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxtYgIyGjwuqmo0oBB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-14T06:59:24Z", "author": "iChrisBirch", "text": "Great explanations and examples with good drawings.

First a description, then some Python code.\n\nDescription:  \nAssuming you are given a  list of known length and constant size datatype, treat the values in the list as \"stacks\" of bits, with the most significant bit at the top, going down to the least.  Place a pointer at the beginning and a separate pointer at the end of the list.  Looking at the current bit of interest ( boi ), which for the first pass is the top bit, advance the left pointer to the right until it is on a value whose boi is not 0.  Advance the right pointer to the left until it is on a value whose boi is not 1.  Swap the values at the two pointers.  Continue this process ( which is very similar to Quicksort's pointers ) until the pointers meet.  Then take the left portion of the list with all 0's for the boi, and sort that part based on the next bit down; do the same for the right side of the list with all 1's for boi.\n\nWhen you have iterated over all values for all bits, the list is sorted.  If it was not apparent in the above description, this sorting algorithm does no value-to-value comparison, save for checking the equality of the indices of the two pointers.  Thus, it is not under the theoretical restriction of O(NLogN) space.  \n\nThe sorting takes place within the confines of the list itself, so it appears to be O(1) space.\n\nThe number of passes per value is dependent on the number of bits (B) being sorted, so it appears to be O(NB) space.  However, for any given real-world list, the maximum number of bits is constant, yet also equal to the Base2 log of the maximum length of the list.  So, what is the \"proper\" Big O time complexity of this algorithm?\n\nThis algorithm is what I call Simple Bitsort.  If there is any interest, I can talk about Complex Bitsort, which does away with the limitation of sorting by only 1 bit at a time.\n\n# This is an implementation of Simple Bitsort\n# pat. pending\n\n\r\n\r\ndef onZero(val, shiftBit):\r\n    mask = 0b01 << shiftBit\r\n    return val & mask == 0\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndef bitSort(arr, begin, end, shiftBit):\r\n    if end - begin <= 0 or shiftBit < 0:\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    LP = begin - 1\r\n    RP = end + 1\r\n\r\n    while True:\r\n        LP += 1\r\n        if LP == RP:\r\n            bitSort(arr, begin, LP - 1, shiftBit - 1)\r\n            if RP <= end:\r\n                bitSort(arr, RP, end, shiftBit - 1)\r\n            return\r\n        if onZero(arr[LP], shiftBit):\r\n            continue\r\n        else:\r\n            while True:\r\n                RP -= 1\r\n                if RP == LP:\r\n                    bitSort(arr, RP, end, shiftBit - 1)\r\n                    if LP >= begin:\r\n                        bitSort(arr, begin, LP - 1, shiftBit - 1)\r\n                    return\r\n                if not onZero(arr[RP], shiftBit):\r\n                    continue\r\n                else:\r\n                    arr[LP] = arr[LP] ^ arr[RP]\r\n                    arr[RP] = arr[LP] ^ arr[RP]\r\n                    arr[LP] = arr[LP] ^ arr[RP]\r\n                    break\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# A short sample lists to sort\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    print('Bitsort, pat. pend.')\r\n\r\n    arr = [5, 2, 1, 3, 0, 6, 4, 255, 12, 83, 7, 16, 119, 0]\r\n    print(arr.__repr__())\r\n    bitSort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1, 8)\r\n    print(arr.__repr__())", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwljrBRMo0-S6Whg0V4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-10T16:17:25Z", "author": "goblinkoma", "text": "In general a very good explanation of the topic, yet for anyone who is somewhat familiar with the basic idea of the topic or the scaling of different mathematical functions the expalations are generally very slow.
