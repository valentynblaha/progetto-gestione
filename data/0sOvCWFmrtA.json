Now, when we write like this :- (id) or like (2), because of only single value, it is considered as integer, and not a tuple even parenthesis are used. \nBut if we just put a comma and make it like this:- (id,) or (2,), it is indicative of multiple values, and now the object is a tuple, which is an iterable.\n\nHere, we actually do not need the string conversion that is being shown here as cursor.execute(...,str(id)), and we can simply do it as cursor.execute(... , (id,)). It is better actually. \n\nBut nevertheless, this content is best in Youtube.

For tuples with a single object, write '(object, )' instead of '(object)'. \n\nFirstly, we should look at some signatures.\n\nThe execute method for cursor objects:\ndef execute(self, query: str | bytes | Composable, vars: _Vars = ...) -> None: ...\n\nThe _Vars type alias:\n_Vars: TypeAlias = Sequence[Any] | Mapping[str, Any] | None\r\n\nThese explain what makes the 'convert to str' workaround tick. But as you've demonstrated before while writing the create_posts function, you can pass non-string values (e.g., bools in the case of post.published) just fine. So, why wasn't '(id)' working? I think this is because of the weird syntax of Python's tuples. '(id)' is not necessarily a tuple, and therefore not a sequence either. But '(id, )' is always a tuple in Python, and so it works just fine. But when you're forcing it to be a tuple with that extra comma, your previous workaround of converting to string becomes redundant. And because that workaround doesn't always work, I think it's safe to say that we should try not to write code that way.

Simply put, the connection.execute('SQL', (VARIABLES,)) function expects you to pass in the variables in a tuple. In python, you cannot declare a tuple of length one unless you specify it. Two ways to specify that, first is to cast it to the tuple() function, and the other option is to pass in the first item of the tuple and put a single comma (item1,) to indicate a tupple. So, what happens is, when you pass a single item to the tuple and no comma, the () are stripped away and the type of the item gets passed directly.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxQ8JPINm_dth0rz8Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-14T11:30:38Z", "author": "spoilka666", "text": "thanks a lot!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzWSWcKJ-i8aghBx8J4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-14T08:42:54Z", "author": "Ahsan Jamil", "text": "A question here if anyone can help out!

So as Sanjeev mentioned you can just use \n(value,) # this is assuming its a single value\nor \n(value1, value2) or (value1, value2,)\n09:38:15 So I believe here you could just place bool as the type validation because then if then send 0 it should transform to false or if they do 1 then it should transform to true and vice-versa. So whichever value you wanted can be taken from it.\n10:26:10 This error is kind of interesting and I got it as well. I think the best way to go about troubleshooting is to understand that pydantic is going to an error when it isn't provided with sufficient  data as opposed to being provided with too much. After all the response model is meant to cut down the data that is shown to the client. So with this in mind for my schema I made it inherit it from the base model (our imported class) rather than from one of created schema. I think stacking too many schemas put's double the requirements specifically  for the title and content field. One good method to debug this is by inserting in default values into the fields that are causing validation errors as this will create a trail leading you to the issue.\n~ 10:15:26 - 10:28:21  more or less here when you group on a column and return columns that are not in the group by nor  being aggregated by a function such as SUM() then you will get an error from SQL. Although I'm not sure why Postgresql didn't return an error. While I was using MS-SQL Server I just did a windowing analytic function such as ...\nfunc.count(models.<insert your orm model>.<insert your column>).over(partition_by=models.<insert your orm model>.<insert your column(group by column)>)).label(\"<quoi qu'il soit>\")\n\nhttps://vitux.com/how-to-edit-config-files-in-ubuntu/\na good website if you had some issues using vi in ubuntu\n\n12:59:16  if you have problems with your virtual environment where gunicorn isnt in the bin directory then you can use this instead  after installing the library python3 -m venv.\n\n~13:50:00 Around here more or less is where I was having issues connecting to postgres in the container . So What I did was just follow a similar process to what we did for the Ubuntu droplet on digital ocean. So i went into pg_hba and changed some of those settings to md5 and then to be safe in postgres.conf I enabled \"*\" for the local connections.\nAlso I had to start the container with the image and then run alembic. Then do docker-compose down and then start it up again.\n\n14:05:00 Here I hadn't been able to log in from the command line nor push any image from docker desktop. So it turns out you can just slightly modify a file in /.docker/config.json just change credsStore to credStore. I'm also using WSL2.\n\n15:10:00 if you start getting errors during the pytests with the traceback involving pydantic you made need this \"../.env\".\nedit: actually it turns out the .env file needs to be in the cwd so that can be for if you decide to enter into a different directory.\n\n15:44:00 \ud83d\ude05 setting up alembic to do this looks to be way harder than he makes it seem. I reccommend either swapping the sqlalchemy.url in your env.py or just creating a seperate alembic init for the test db", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxNW1p0nIfO4Wr5j2B4AaABAg.9UODzn7iQ_39UQs5OFjVRs", "publishedAt": "2021-11-07T03:01:21Z", "author": "rainwave5", "text": "05:53:42 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwbUI8-vvlIF5z2GyF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-06T00:46:47Z", "author": "David Perez", "text": "Great course!
