Then you can create indexes based on these different situations. The other thing is external access to the db by reporting/other external products. If these is true I will use SQL.\n\nIf I am treating the blocks of data more like groups of related objects (either able to be dynamic or non-dynamic schemas) and primarily using it in a custom programming project then I will choose NoSQL for the massively increased speed and ease of use in programming (using a DB that has a .net 6+ library). As no external systems need to hit it (as they would be part of the project) the more 'open' SQL system is not required. Typically I will use a code-based schema, so we have a static schema that is easily modifiable and definable.\n\nI don't use graphql as queries can spiral out massively very quickly ;P", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Abhirup Paul", "text": "U look like khalisi from game of throne", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Murilo Lopes", "text": "For your voice alone, the video would be worth it.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Michel Salloum", "text": "I can not understand your accent lady Ania", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "bala kumar", "text": "Good", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "satish8299", "text": "Where in Ukraine or Russia do you liev Ania.
