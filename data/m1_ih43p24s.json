I wanted to offer some helpful advice if I may.  This is not meant to attack you, or to minimise the nice job you did in presenting the material.  What I'd like to offer is the thought that perhaps it would have been much simpler and easier to understand if you had used a \"number\" data type for a \"total\" field, and also a \"number\" data type for the \"current\" field, which is the current field being entered.  It doesn't seem that a \"string\" type is the right type for a calculator, which is meant to calculate numeric values.\n\nFor example, if you had made the variable a number, then you could have done the '%' function as: \"this.total /= 100.0\", and that would be it.  When a person presses an operator, you would store the operation into a variable, (such as addition for '+'), and then before you change to a new operator you resolve the current one.  You would have to implement a calculation stack if you wanted to support proper operator precedence.  You could also have a \"total\" variable that contains the current total, which is different from the \"current\" value being entered.  To add a new digit to the present \"current\" you could then do the formula (current * 10 + digit).  By doing this, you avoid all this parsing of strings.  Javascript is capable of displaying number values easily, either with floating point or with fixed point.\n\ni hope this was helpful.", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwV_Ov69PPPa3qguPF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-12-23T21:05:43Z", "author": "Brawndo", "text": "I cringed a little over all the type coercion (strings to numbers and back again)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxCIel4Sy6l6dM3EYp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-12-21T15:40:28Z", "author": "Jeremy Leach", "text": "IF YOU ARE LIKE HEY WHY NO CLI INSTRUCTIONS::: HERE THEY ARE.
