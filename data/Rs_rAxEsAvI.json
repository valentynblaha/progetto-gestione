In this course you will learn to make a self-driving car simulation by implementing every component step-by-step. You will learn how to implement the car driving mechanics, how to define the environment, how to simulate some sensors, how to detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using a neural network.\n\nThe course covers how artificial neural networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. You will learn how to implement a neural network and how to visualize it so we can see it in action.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor created this course.

Here is my dabbling that will get you a little red car that drives similar to a real car and wraps the canvas. parallax scrolling is very simple to switch over to upon reaching that point in creation. here are the three prompts(preceded with p:) and comments(preceded with #'s): \r\n## initial prompt sent processing, there are 2 addition prompts (with respective comment)\r\np: Create a red car on a light grey background that the user may drive with keyboard controls. The dimensions of the car are 20 units wide by 35 units long. The car has properties for x position, y position, current velocity, max velocity, direction angle, acceleration rate and steering rate. The cars current velocity is 0. The cars direction angle is 0. The cars max velocity is 10 units per second. The car acceleration rate is 1 unit per second squared. The car steering rate is 10 degrees per second squared. Create a function to recieve input from the user. The up keyboard key increases the cars current velocity by the cars acceleration rate. The cars current velocity can not be greater than the cars max velocity. The down keyboard key decreases the cars current velocity by the inverse of the cars acceleration rate. The cars current velocity can not be lesser than the inverse of the cars max velocity. The left arrow key decreases the cars direction angle by the cars steering rate. When the cars direction angle is less than 0 degrees the cars direction angle is set to 360 degrees. The right arrow key increases the cars direction angle by the cars steering rate. When the cars direction angle is greater than 360 degrees the cars direction angle is set to 0 degrees. Create an update function that calculates the cars x and y position using the cars velocitiy, acceleration and direction. If the cars x position is greater than 600 units it is set to 0. If the cars x position is less than 0 it is set to 600. If the cars y position is greater than 400 units it is set to 0. If the cars y position is less than 0 it is set to 400. Create an animate function that displays the car on the screen. The function uses requestAnimationFrame to simulate smooth animation to the user. The function redraws the screen only if the cars x or y position have changed since last function call. \r\n\r\n## needed to reset =)\r\np: create function to reset car. this function will set cars x to 50, y to 50, current velocity to 0 and direction angle to 0.\r\n\r\n## needed some reality =D\r\np: add a decelerate function to the car. this function will apply a deceleration factor of 0.05 per second squared to cars current velocity until the cars velocity has reached 0. add a keyIsDown property to the car. update the input function to set the keyIsDown to true if a keyboard key up or keyboard key down is currently being pressed and false otherwise. update the cars update function to call the cars deceleration function if keyIsDown is not true.\r\n\r\n## LOL I sure did oof that if you are following along. the fix which should have been original implimentation(you can easily modify it if you want!). I personally like throwing these live edits at the ai because its fun to think about if it's \"smart\" enough to figure it out and then watching it actually solve the issue so elegantly, and I also threw in a more abstract concept of 'truth table' =D\r\np: create a function to detect input function from user and set a truth table of key up and key down for the keyboard up, down, left and right arrow keys. update the cars input function use the values from truth table instead of directly detecting key press.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Christopher Ferrin", "text": "@Radu Mariescu-Istodor yes actually I bet you could get same code with half as much prompt!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Radu Mariescu-Istodor", "text": "@Christopher Ferrin Ok, I just got time to check this out.
