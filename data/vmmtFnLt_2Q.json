Thank you for sharing @PixemWeb! I'm a freelancer, but mostly just starting out, so I'm still getting used to the freelance life, but one thing that really struck me was towards the beginning of this where the work gets done anywhere (and everywhere!). I've worked on the beach, in the car, in the Bellagio in Las Vegas, and so many other places. \n\nAlso, something else that I related to very closely was that schedule. Like I said, I'm still trying to get used to the freelancer life and am still packing way too much into my days. Gotta find balance, especially with the flexibility freelancing brings!\n\nI am wondering, looks like you use visual studio code. Why do you use this one over others? I've recently tried both Atom and Sublime and I love Atom, but I hear a lot of people say there are much better choices out there.\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to checking out your channel!

The Network+ book I ended up getting because I was developing a website for a nonprofit organization and they were having issues with their office network. They asked if I could take a look at what could be the issue. I already had some basic network knowledge from the almighty Google, but since this was larger than my home network, I wanted to fine tune my knowledge. I told them it wasn\u2019t my area of expertise but I\u2019d take a look at it. First I took a physical look at their setup. Lots of computers with wires all over. So I mapped it all out, did some research and over the course of a couple of weeks, got their office network properly wired, updated, secured and running smoothly. A trained technician could have done it in 2 days lol. \n\nSo is this helpful for a web developer? Maybe not, but as a freelancer, you\u2019ll find that you end up picking up a bunch of affinity/related skills. \n\nI\u2019m also the type who tries to learn as much as possible. It\u2019s my curse.

It was a weird time since I was in a transition phase but looking back over the years, I know in my gut that I made the right decision.

Go through the course, do all the work, go through the parts multiple times you don't understand, google your questions, find other free tutorials and go through them, and just immerse yourself into learning. If you have an idea, make it happen. The crazy thing about programming is if it doesn't exist, you can probably make it (with enough knowledge/guidance).\n\nNow, with that said, web development has two main paths. Programming the websites and creating them.  Creating them is much easier to learn as you rely on other peoples code. Usually, something like Wordpress is your base, then you augment that with themes and plugins. On the other hand, programming the websites requires specialize knowledge (there's different languages, you could go with PHP and still use Wordpress as a base and create your own themes/plugins, or you could go Python/Django, or javascript or many others, each with their own pros and cons).\n\nMy advice, if this is something you're interested in, is to start with learning web design with wordpress, along with some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then, if you like it enough, go from there.\n\nNo matter what you want to do, just do it and go all in.
