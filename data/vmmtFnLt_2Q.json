Thank you for sharing @PixemWeb! I'm a freelancer, but mostly just starting out, so I'm still getting used to the freelance life, but one thing that really struck me was towards the beginning of this where the work gets done anywhere (and everywhere!). I've worked on the beach, in the car, in the Bellagio in Las Vegas, and so many other places. \n\nAlso, something else that I related to very closely was that schedule. Like I said, I'm still trying to get used to the freelancer life and am still packing way too much into my days. Gotta find balance, especially with the flexibility freelancing brings!\n\nI am wondering, looks like you use visual studio code. Why do you use this one over others? I've recently tried both Atom and Sublime and I love Atom, but I hear a lot of people say there are much better choices out there.\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to checking out your channel!

It's great to have a look at the life of a freelance web developer working from home. I can really relate, since this is my end goal. To be a freelance web developer working from home. I am in sales, currently, but i study web development with the help of books and the FCC. At 4.22 there is a pic of a pile of books, obviously books you have used in your learning to code journey, couple of them i have myself. I noticed a Network+ book. May i ask. Do you have networks/IT related knowledge? If yes, in what way is it useful in a web developer career generally or in your situation specifically?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "PixemWeb", "text": "No problem", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Lampros Chatzinikolaou", "text": "Thanks for the answer.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "PixemWeb", "text": "Lampros Chatzinikolaou thanks for watching the video. The Network+ book I ended up getting because I was developing a website for a nonprofit organization and they were having issues with their office network. They asked if I could take a look at what could be the issue. I already had some basic network knowledge from the almighty Google, but since this was larger than my home network, I wanted to fine tune my knowledge. I told them it wasn\u2019t my area of expertise but I\u2019d take a look at it. First I took a physical look at their setup. Lots of computers with wires all over. So I mapped it all out, did some research and over the course of a couple of weeks, got their office network properly wired, updated, secured and running smoothly. A trained technician could have done it in 2 days lol. \n\nSo is this helpful for a web developer? Maybe not, but as a freelancer, you\u2019ll find that you end up picking up a bunch of affinity/related skills. \n\nI\u2019m also the type who tries to learn as much as possible. It\u2019s my curse.

But I was at a cross roads that required me to decide which path I wanted to go in. I could have continued in the career that would have been my comfort zone where I was making 6 figure money, but that meant I would have to be away from my growing family for large portions of the year which is why I then chose to dabble in local real estate and ultimately decided to go full-time as a freelance web developer. It was a weird time since I was in a transition phase but looking back over the years, I know in my gut that I made the right decision. Granted, it took time to start making real money but I had saved up and went ALL-IN. My biggest recommendation is to make sure to diversify your revenue stream, save up as much as you can, live below your means for a while and never give up.", "likes": 5}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "MarcoCoffeeFirst!", "text": "Very nice.

Thanks.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Soul Scribbler", "text": "I think what PixemWeb said is all great advice, but I will add find a high rated, high student count course in what you want to learn on Udemy and buy it during a sale ($10-$15) then go all in on it. Go through the course, do all the work, go through the parts multiple times you don't understand, google your questions, find other free tutorials and go through them, and just immerse yourself into learning. If you have an idea, make it happen. The crazy thing about programming is if it doesn't exist, you can probably make it (with enough knowledge/guidance).\n\nNow, with that said, web development has two main paths. Programming the websites and creating them.  Creating them is much easier to learn as you rely on other peoples code. Usually, something like Wordpress is your base, then you augment that with themes and plugins. On the other hand, programming the websites requires specialize knowledge (there's different languages, you could go with PHP and still use Wordpress as a base and create your own themes/plugins, or you could go Python/Django, or javascript or many others, each with their own pros and cons).\n\nMy advice, if this is something you're interested in, is to start with learning web design with wordpress, along with some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then, if you like it enough, go from there.\n\nNo matter what you want to do, just do it and go all in. Honestly, immersion the only way.", "likes": 3}, {"author": "PixemWeb", "text": "I learned by reading books, the online documentation pages of the various coding languages, online tutorials from sites like Lynda, TeamTreeHouse, Pluralsight, YouTube. \nFreeCodeCamp wasn't around when I first started learning.
