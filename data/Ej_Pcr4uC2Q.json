Dart is a strictly typed programming language that is used in the Flutter framework to develop cross platform mobile apps.\n\nSince Dart supports both AOT (Ahead of time) and JIT (Just In Time) compilation, it delivers extremely fast development cycles and fast execution and startup times. It is a compiled programming language and can also transpile the code into JavaScript.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Course from Mahmud Ahsan. \n\ud83d\udd17 Mahmud's Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHlgyUw0wLE5Ous9swfFlg\n\ud83d\udd17 Mahmud's Github: https://github.com/mahmudahsan/\n\ud83d\udd17 Mahmud's Blog: https://thinkdiff.net/\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Dart language: https://dart.dev/\n\ud83d\udd17 Flutter Framework: https://flutter.dev/\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:00:32) Setup\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:03:50) Fundamentals\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:11:04) Data Types\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:15:44) String, Type Conversion, Constant, null\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:23:50) Operators\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:39:13) Loop\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:48:03) Collections [ List, Set, Map ]\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:01:07) Function\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:13:49) Class\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:37:41) Exception Handling\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:41:26) Conclusion\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT1H41M53S", "likes": "12974", "views": "674511"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy_-U7qqWkj9l8adTl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-02-03T12:02:13Z", "author": "sudip basak", "text": "\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwFeUnWP-bvhc-hiI54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-01-30T21:25:34Z", "author": "Ralph Reilly", "text": "Great video.

I wanna just point you that even for dynamically typed languages. The type is known at compile time because Python, Ruby and JS are compiled to bytecode then the byte code is interpreted. The difference between static and dynamic is in the types of values a variable can take. In dynamic you can assign a different type to a  variable without complains from the the interpreter which is not possible in static languages.
