In this talk, we\u2019ll give you a tour of the state of the art: through code-level demos based on Open Source libraries like Apache MXNet or Keras, we\u2019ll demonstrate advanced models based on CNN, GAN and LSTM architectures, which solve complex problems such as image detection, image generation and machine translation. \n\nWe\u2019ll also show how to customize models on your own data set and how to use them in your own applications. Last but not least, you\u2019ll learn how to deploy these models in production with just a few lines of code thanks to Amazon SageMaker.\n\nTalk by Julien Simon at Devoxx Poland 2018.\n\nThanks to Devoxx for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
