It primarily applies to less technical professions where there isn't as much variance. I definitely recommend - as you mentioned - listing the tech you're both proficient with & interested in focusing on. Just listing PHP, C, C#, Java & Python, for example, will make you look like you're all over the map. However, what I am advocating, you mentioned your core focus is front-end - HTML, CSS, Javascript & React - then yes \"everything you've touched\" like Git, NPM, SASS, Node.js, SEO, Gulp, Web Pack etc.\n\nI hope this clarifies what I meant :) Great question!", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwsHhFU384rmdhDDJB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-12T23:37:16Z", "author": "Martin Payne", "text": "I asked on the freeCodeCamp forum whether I should say HTML and CSS or HTML 5 and CSS3 and was almost unanimously told to stick with just HTML and CSS because it\u2019s implicitly understood (and listing the number could make you look like a beginner who doesn\u2019t know anything). I also had the opposite advice about listing everything you\u2019ve ever used.
