That said I don\u2019t actually know any of those languages and only list JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, React, Git, Node.js, and Sass on my resume because I\u2019m targeting web development.

Is just following the google lighthouse audit guidelines to get SEO to 100% without having deep knowledge about whats really going on enough to list SEO or should I stay away from that unless I have deep knowledge?

It primarily applies to less technical professions where there isn't as much variance. I definitely recommend - as you mentioned - listing the tech you're both proficient with & interested in focusing on. Just listing PHP, C, C#, Java & Python, for example, will make you look like you're all over the map. However, what I am advocating, you mentioned your core focus is front-end - HTML, CSS, Javascript & React - then yes \"everything you've touched\" like Git, NPM, SASS, Node.js, SEO, Gulp, Web Pack etc.\n\nI hope this clarifies what I meant :) Great question!", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Martin Payne", "text": "I asked on the freeCodeCamp forum whether I should say HTML and CSS or HTML 5 and CSS3 and was almost unanimously told to stick with just HTML and CSS because it\u2019s implicitly understood (and listing the number could make you look like a beginner who doesn\u2019t know anything). I also had the opposite advice about listing everything you\u2019ve ever used. If I list Angular , Vue, and React even though I\u2019ve just done todo apps and the examples from the documentation that could make my statements about skills I actually have deep knowledge in like core JavaScript have less value.", "likes": 6}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Maxime Daraize", "text": "I feel his portfolio came from Traversy Media (responsive portfolio website tutorial) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzHS-n2gqU&list=PLillGF-RfqbYoGoCjKoMOkVznV6aSXKzU", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Emircan ERKUL", "text": "Please countinue this concept *Thank you*", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"author": "Benjamin Spak", "text": "Will do :)", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Anand Undavia", "text": "For anyone wondering, the template of the resume is available on Google Docs Templates", "likes": 11}, "replies": [{"author": "PitchBlack C0d3", "text": "lol", "likes": 0}, {"author": "pyrotechnick", "text": "Ah yes I remember when they first added it the resume template to google docs, I had been waiting for it lol", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Benjamin Spak", "text": "Good call!
