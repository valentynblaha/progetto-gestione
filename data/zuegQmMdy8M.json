Adding the \"const\" before our pointer C seems like it would mean that C is a constant - i.e. the memory address held in C cannot be changed.

Apparently, the const applies to the value pointed at by C regardless of what memory address is held in C? Why does this const pass through our variable C (a pointer) to the value pointed at by C (a char)?

This language was widely used on the Soviet Union computers. However, it was unknown outside the Soviet Union and usually Harold Lawson is credited with the invention, in 1964, of the pointer.[2] In 2000, Lawson was presented the Computer Pioneer Award by the IEEE \"[f]or inventing the pointer variable and introducing this concept into PL/I, thus providing for the first time, the capability to flexibly treat linked lists in a general-purpose high-level language\".[3] His seminal paper on the concepts appeared in the June 1967 issue of CACM entitled: PL/I List Processing. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word pointer first appeared in print as a stack pointer in a technical memorandum by the System Development Corporation.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzz0mtxNl3zVnBFRr54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-10T18:15:30Z", "author": "UnknownDev", "text": "I dream of a world  where I can click on an english computer science video without getting earraped by some indian.\n\nedit: fortunately he sounds alright and not like the others", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgymRRWgzGV_XwSp61l4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-10T03:20:17Z", "author": "Ram Chhabra", "text": "2:47:21", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyuU9vXidAgmJs4FNR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-08T14:32:58Z", "author": "Jashan 092", "text": "this is giving me this error \nsamba_6.c: In function \u2018Add\u2019:\nsamba_6.c:7:12: warning: function returns address of local variable [-Wreturn-local-addr]\n    7 |     return &c;\ncode :\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdlib.h>\n\nint *Add(int* a, int* b)\n{\n    int c = (*a) + (*b);\n    return &c;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int x=2,y=4;\n    int* ptr = Add(&x,&y);\n    printf(\"Sum = %d\\n\",*ptr);\n}", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyhdcilxYH8cj3fyAJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-08T11:18:58Z", "author": "Aditya Ojha", "text": "These videos are a blessing to all those hustlers...", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw7DCn-wtAGknJSihN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-08T00:40:47Z", "author": "JustMoseyinAround", "text": "1:04:55", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgygpCSglvAwBC64wVF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-07T19:12:50Z", "author": "Aryan Singh", "text": "2:07:13 can someone explain me *(C[1]+1)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgygRRW3WJghdu78wHd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-07T14:46:39Z", "author": "Lhasun Gaming", "text": "anyone who cold help to mention some resources to practice with array and 2d pointers or pointer with multidimensional array.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxFs4wYFhGdIsobwqh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-07T10:45:43Z", "author": "thunderCodes;", "text": "At 1:27:42 c2[1] gives 'e' not 'l' but the video is really awesome", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxFXyJpBbAh4KbUWnh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-05T05:19:22Z", "author": "Abhishek M.R", "text": "Does anyone knows any channel on YouTube that teaches leetcode problems ??", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy-pTx_a_sQIFna8g54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-04T07:57:51Z", "author": "Ammar Rashid", "text": "Thank you so much!

Even comparing with the same CPU, some of these are simply choice and this is why we have the \"size of A\" function to check that they are acting as expected. For example a \"long long int\" default could be 32 or 64 or 128 bits depending on language compiler and target CPU, and you can manually change this compiler configuration. This is because you may be compiling the same source code several times for different CPUs. ie for some cases int is 16b, short is 8b, and both long and long long types are 32;  for clang and gcc default for AMD64 is int=32 and long-long=128b, but you could add a compile time flag to change the int to 64b or everything to 32b. \nFloat names are more standard so a double is 64bit everywhere I have looked. But the \"long double\" can often create a mistake, some interpret long-double as IEEE-754 float128, some simply ignore the long and use 64bit double; and others interpret long-double as an 80bit \"extended precision\" float; 80bit matches the x87 floating point hardware unit that is combined with some CPUs. \nAnd a few terrible implementations (*cough*python numpy*cough*) have been known to actually use 80bit when you use explicit \"float128\" or \"float96\" keywords in your source. These 80bit floats may actually be padded with zeros to use 12 or 16 bytes of memory (96 or 128bits) to keep the typical 4 or 8 byte alignment of memory addresses and cache lines, but the x87 math unit only uses 10 bytes.", "likes": 12}, {"id": "Ugza2Wf4eBtViRVkzbV4AaABAg.9KKyQL7umbr9RavsyyR37W", "publishedAt": "2021-08-28T20:31:57Z", "author": "Jorge Matute", "text": "Thanks!", "likes": 1}, {"id": "Ugza2Wf4eBtViRVkzbV4AaABAg.9KKyQL7umbr9RMkFLaWWwT", "publishedAt": "2021-08-22T23:01:40Z", "author": "J M", "text": "Thank you!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzNFtHwW7NiraZrtId4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-27T17:40:51Z", "author": "Justin Power", "text": "This is the only video I\u2019ve found that doesn\u2019t over simplify the subject.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyk_9rPCeX-aXwnhuV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-27T14:09:14Z", "author": "Suraj chaugule 00", "text": "I read full story. \nending was so sad\n Respect harsha", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyip4UhAcXk7KkGWZp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-27T02:02:24Z", "author": "SenthilAndavan Palani", "text": "Could someone please tell me what are the topics covered such as introduction to pointer,  how to declare a  pointer,dereference operator,  pointer arithmetic, Accessing a pointer variable,...etc", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwsppYd8ETQ6LKyy_Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-26T22:14:21Z", "author": "reynaldi aditia", "text": "really good and the best explanation in c so far. we can look at how he really passionate about it.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxR2riPKXU4lr9n-t14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-26T15:18:02Z", "author": "\u0645\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0641\u064a\u0646", "text": "thank you bro for all things you are ammazing", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxcazWDyXp7jdEDMRp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-26T08:02:44Z", "author": "sunil kumar", "text": "So informative \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw00DenrMScNFloZ7d4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-25T18:30:19Z", "author": "Sam Sepoil", "text": "3:02:10", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwV3Duh_qTVC8dv2mp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-25T16:23:50Z", "author": "bhargav ikkurthi", "text": "i would definitely donate this channel when i start earning.", "likes": 6}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzQIgqkxgLCI0Idend4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-25T00:35:02Z", "author": "Rasan", "text": "This video is by far the most helpful video I have ever watched on pointers.
