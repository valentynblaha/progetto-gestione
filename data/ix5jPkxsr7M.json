When you have a pointer to some address in memory, and then you have a second pointer that will start from the first pointer and \"walk\" along the data structure, what do you say the difference is when both pointers are equal,. i.e. when the mobile pointer is pointing to the first element? The difference is zero, that's its offset. So to say you're grabbing the value at address `pointer + 0` (offset zero units from the start of the data) is to say that you're grabbing the first element. if `*(array + 0)` was equivalent to `array[1]` instead of `array[0]`, arrays would be a LOT harder to navigate and off-by-one errors would be a lot more common.\n\nThat's the real reason: Pointer arithmetic, file offsets, anywhere you are dealing with offsets (which turns out to be most of the time), zero indexing is more mathematically natural. Or if you're pushing elements into an array by using its length: `array[length] = value`, `memcpy(array + length, array2, MIN(availablesize, length2))`, and then `array` s length is incremented by the number of bytes added. It's simple. People only think it's hard because they deal with C strings which tack on an extra byte at the end while not considering it part of the array (strlen returns the length excluding the final byte).", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx3_qAHlwv6Wn1ryXt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-09T05:59:15Z", "author": "Floating Sunfish", "text": "Goodness, jumping from Scratch to C sounds like a recipe for disaster. \ud83d\ude02\nI've been writing programs for years and still haven't bothered to relearn C and C++ because I just never needed the extra performance (yet).", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz95Y8ocIcTq6GrqMx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-07T10:16:40Z", "author": "cepi24", "text": "in 1:36:37 - those random numbers which comes after 0.2000000 ... where they are come from?
