As a form of feedback for @Tech Talks With Santosh, I'd say to design a project that you'd build along as with content this long it can just seem jarring by the amount of information we need to cover. Rather than coming up with use cases and random examples on the fly, a build along series would really help put all the puzzle pieces together and understand why we should do things in certain ways.
