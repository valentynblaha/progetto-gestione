User research is important and all the top tech companies like FAANG utilise user research and considering that one of the top reasons why start-ups fail is because they are creating something that people don't actually want to use really highlights how important user research is but it is also massively overlooked by people like you. For example, if you have an app and you are only 30% of users are going past the landing page, is it because they are confused? Is the information unclear? Does the website look unprofessional? Is the price too high? These are questions can only really be answered by doing user research. A sample size of a group of engineers who know the ins and outs of the project is not useful, you want a potential customer who is discovering this for the first time. What Steve Jobs is referring to is that you need to get your prototype or product in front of the users and see how they interact with it. You can't just ask questions with no basis. In the beginning  that might work to get a general idea but to really move forward you need to evaluate how people are interacting with what you are making.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Dheep Shemare", "text": "We a not worthy of free camp code.
