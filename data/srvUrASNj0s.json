While in Inspect mode, click the icon on the panel that looks like a phone sitting in front of a tablet. That'll allow for testing your page on different screen sizes, from 4K screens to smartphones. Best done with Chrome and its derivatives, like Vivaldi or Brave.\n\nAlso, dock your Inspect panel to the left, if it isn't there already.
