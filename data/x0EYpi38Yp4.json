I know this video is old but I'm wondering if anyone can help me conceptually. I'm writing HTML files on my computer in Dreamweaver. I've created a repository and I've cloned it. Now here's where I'm lost. I don't see updates to my HTML anywhere. What is a comit? You did a commit but never said what it was. You used Terminal to write a readme but never said where the readme file was. I'm sure everyone who is using Git isn't writing in Terminal. What if I'm using BBEdit or some other editor, I certainly can't type terminal commands. I understand what Git is supposed to do for me much better thanks to this video, but for newbies, there still a lot not being explained.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Capt Logan's PS4 Live", "text": "Thanks, again, Tiff.
