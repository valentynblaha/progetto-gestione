That's not what's happening there. Whenever true is compared using loose equality, it's converted to a 1. Then the comparison becomes 1 == '1'. At this point, '1' is converted to 1 (because using loose equality, when comparing a number to a string, the string is implicitly coerced to a number). So at this point, it becomes 1 == 1, which causes it to evaluate as true.", "likes": 7}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "#hashtagTrends", "text": "Thank You @t !", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Akshit Thakur", "text": "Anybody else impressed with his typing speed?", "likes": 5}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Armaan D", "text": "wow you explained this so well. thank you so much!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Daivik Bijoy", "text": "good one", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Aar\u00f3n Argotte L\u00f3pez", "text": "<3", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Oscar Rios", "text": "thank you !", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "koko", "text": "I wish I could type that fast", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Lucas Almeida", "text": "Thank you!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Trumpet Man", "text": "Thank you for this clear explanation", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "somnvm", "text": "That's weird, i mean usually we have to use 3 characters instead of 2.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Moaz El-sawaf", "text": "Thanks a lot sir <3", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Dkyguy1995", "text": "I had no idea JS could tell true == 1.
