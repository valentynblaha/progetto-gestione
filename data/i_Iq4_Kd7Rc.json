Thanks for this tutorial, I had a lot of fun learning C++ and developing my first plugin along with you. I implemented new features to it (more parametric bands, double click return values, customized GUI, etc). The next feature I would like to add is a toggle button for each band to change the filter type to a band pass so you can ear the audio signal at the frequency of your filter. This is something you can do with Fabfilter EQ (with the headset button) and it's very useful when you are looking for resonances. Any idea how this could be implemented?

It's probably worth skimming each section of the vid a few times - I first tried this tutorial a few weeks ago and got destroyed early on by too many errors (C++ noob stuff). I didn't repo that attempt properly, so I deleted the project and just recently started over again, and made it to about halfway through the tutorial with no fails so far (and all changes recorded in Git). If I had the Git stuff working properly before, I probably could have salvaged that first attempt quite easily. Hence I'd still recommend grasping it ;) But you're totally right, repo'ing (or not) does NOT interfere with the code itself at all. Be sure to pause the video and check every. single. line.

Personally, I'd recommend studying how Git and repo's work as a separate tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk ) and WOULD recommend following MatKat's advice on the matter; It makes it really easy to \"step back in time\" in your code, by creating something like \"save points\" along the way. This is a total life-saver when you find that you've broken some code, missed a step, etc and are unable to figure out what went wrong. With a well-maintained repo, you can easily just step back to a previous \"commit\" (some earlier version of your code) where everything was working fine, and try doing that step again, or try a new method etc. It's basically a way of managing your \"versioning\" as you go. If you're as new to C++ as I am, then maintaining a repo for this project might save you from situations like getting 3+ hours into the vid, running into errors that you are unsure how to solve, and having to start alllllll over again. You can manage your repo's locally on your machine - i.e., you don't necessarily NEED to upload the code to an online Github repo and make it public, but you MUST respect the licensing system that goes along with the framework you are using ;)", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwRto1IKxuNERzeS_d4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-07T13:26:46Z", "author": "RONSON79", "text": "Is there a guide or tutorial on how to code your own De-Esser?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwRto1IKxuNERzeS_d4AaABAg.9Y8snYeb7669ZH9VIg2pKW", "publishedAt": "2022-03-07T15:06:45Z", "author": "RONSON79", "text": "@Qxy I have De-essers and know the way they work but I would love to have an advanced one which is great at separation to have total control over consonants and esses.

You might have figured this out already but getting into sound design can depend on what you want to create sounds for. I'd say the three broad types are for video (movie/tv/animation/ect.), video games (same techniques as video but implementing them into video games takes special knowledge), and for software tools (where coding languages such as the above video come in handy). \n\nI am not as familiar with sound design for software tools (one of the many reasons I'm on this video) but for video and video games, the main tools you'll want are this:\n\n1. A DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) such as Pro Tools, Ableton, Adobe Audition, Logic, Reaper, ect.\n\n- This is your main workstation, your canvas if you were painting. Every sound that you have recorded will be put into here to edit/manipulate and your virtual audio tools (VSTs usually) will be integrated with this.\n\n2. Field Recorder/Audio Recording Equipment \n- Most sound designers manipulate audio that they record themselves. Don't feel the need to buy fancy expensive audio recording equipment if you're just starting, smartphone audio recording is a great way to get started.\n- Field Recording Equipment is used when you're outside of a controlled studio environment (EX: Recording ocean waves, Vehicles, ect.)\n- Studio Recording Equipment is probably a better choice to start with since you can record anything you bring into your studio and it will be as controlled as the environment you choose to record in (Bedroom, Basement, Home Built Studio, ect.). For this you'll want a microphone and an audio interface (microphone plugs into audio interface, audio interface plugs into computer. You can then record directly into your DAW)\n\n3. Free audio websites (Freesound is my favorite website and probably the most popular for practical sound effects such as crowds, explosions, car engines, ect.)\n- These are great resources for when you don't have any recording equipment but you want to get started in sound design ASAP. it's also a great resource when there is a sound that you have no way of replicating/recording. Once it gets beyond just a hobby and becomes professional, then this resource gets a little dicey since you're using someone else's work. But getting paid to do sound design might be harder than learning sound design lol believe me.\n\n4. Audio Middleware is used for implementing your sound design into video games I would recommend working on your sound design skills for video before attempting this. A good way to practice with video is taking a movie/tv/animation scene and removing all of the sound. Then you can put your video into a DAW (some DAWs aren't nice with video, might take some configuration) and record and manipulate sounds to redesign the sound for that scene. If you want to attempt video games, then you would want these tools:\n- Audio Middleware (Wwise and FMOD are the two most popular software though there are probably others)\n- Wwise works very well with Unity game engine from my experience, while I've noticed FMOD is often used with Unreal Game Engine. I don't have much experience outside of Wwise/Unity though, so other combos probably work well too.\n- Basic C# can be helpful when working with Game Engines though it's not required if you're working solely in an audio middleware. But if you're doing this project completely by yourself, then you'll need C# knowledge for the video game engine scripting . This is why I don't recommend starting with this.\n\nI hope this helps, there are a lot of great resources/communities on reddit, facebook, and other forums. I would also search on YouTube for how your favorite movies, tv shows, video games did their sound design. There's often behind the scenes videos or interviews with the sound designers where they show their process. And if you need to create a specific sound, many YouTubers have created videos showing their process of how they created those sounds. Some googling can do wonders once you know what to even Google. \n\nLastly, remember to HAVE FUN or else this isn't worth pursuing. It's a lot of hard-work and takes technical skills, but you need to keep your creativity because this is still a creative hobby/profession. You are the one imagining what worlds sound like for an audience and it can be an amazing feeling when they feel like they've been sucked into the world you helped create.\n\n\nEDIT: I totally forgot about sound design for live productions such as theater. The same principles apply as with video, but you'll need equipment to trigger the sounds while a live production is going on. I would google equipment that can do this as I don't have a ton of experience with a live setting.", "likes": 3}, {"id": "UgyCyVbAXP0lSDssgIN4AaABAg.9NgJmwSxxIa9W7Fj-r156V", "publishedAt": "2021-12-19T05:14:36Z", "author": "elton wild", "text": "I want to learn sound design.
