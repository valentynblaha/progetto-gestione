That will avoid the crash on Android.\n\nIn general: \nAlways use try-catch around async code! Even tho simcoder does not do it, it will allow you to at least keep your application usable and display a message that lets you know where the actual problem comes from. To make it not crash in the browser I had to add a try-catch around the async function in the useEffect hook in Add.js. In the catch I was able to log an error and setHasPermissions(false); which will show at least whats going on on the screen.\nBig minus point for this tutorial for just assuming things will go fine and not crash.", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Seba", "text": "I was getting the \"firebase.default.firestore is not a function\" error as well.
