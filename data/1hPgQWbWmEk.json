That will avoid the crash on Android.\n\nIn general: \nAlways use try-catch around async code! Even tho simcoder does not do it, it will allow you to at least keep your application usable and display a message that lets you know where the actual problem comes from. To make it not crash in the browser I had to add a try-catch around the async function in the useEffect hook in Add.js.
