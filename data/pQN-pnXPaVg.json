Save an image as batman.jpg \r\n\r\n2. Move that image file to the same folder where the HTML file is. \r\n\r\n3. In the HTML file, copy/paste the following anywhere between <body>   </body> on a new line: \r\n\r\n<img src='batman.jpg' alt='Batman is overrated and a simp!'>\r\n\nThe above way is universally frowned upon as using CSS external stylesheets is widely preferred since they can be conveniently reused.

In other words, it helps you to build the structure of webpages. \n\nThe fundamentals here are enough, but I hope you practiced a lot as just watching the tutorial is not enough. \r\n\r\nLearn HTML and CSS together as they go hand-in-hand. The former is the easiest while the latter is the most challenging yet the most rewarding because it makes your website beautiful by adding font styles, colors, shapes, photos, etc.; you're the best Hollywood plastic surgeon! Afterward, learn Javascript. It adds behavior to your website which CSS can't do. Behavior as in interactivity; if you move your mouse cursor to a photo of Belle Delphine, that photo will change to a photo of The Rock. Or if you move the cursor to a line of text, that text will change to a 100px font size and have a pink background with alice blue text. \r\n\r\nJS will be the most difficult to learn because it involves programming. However, you can still be successful just being focused on HTML and CSS. There are demos of devs who have made some pretty hot websites without JS. HTML and CSS are enough to make stylish websites as I have seen some really great ones, but it all depends on your CSS skills. \r\n\r\nFor HTML, focus a lot of time on learning div, forms, lists, and spans. \r\n\r\nFor CSS, focus a lot of time on learning Grid and responsive design because there are billions of people around the world who browse on their phones. \r\n\r\nAll the best!", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwNzA2nkQmgdOoLthJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-14T20:52:38Z", "author": "Maxim Aries", "text": "Great presentation.

Those two hours could have been spent learning and practicing HTML. Now you're two hours 'behind' your goal. Not playing the blame game here, I have my days of being burned out so I just go and play Overwatch for three hours, but imagine how much more I could have learned about web development by increasing my knowledge by 5%, 10%, or even just 1% within those three hours. Does this mean you should always study and never relax by gaming or watching Netflix? No. Everyone needs rest. Just try not to take advantage of your rest time by gaming ten hours a day and studying for five minutes. \r\n\nI recommend you to learn how to create forms and inputs.HTML is pretty easy to learn.

The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,[4] and is centered on fictional creatures called \"Pok\u00e9mon\", which humans, known as Pok\u00e9mon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. Works within the franchise are set in the Pok\u00e9mon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is \"Gotta Catch 'Em All\".[5][6]\r\n\r\nThe franchise began as Pocket Monsters Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. It soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media.[7] Pok\u00e9mon has since become the highest-grossing media franchise of all time,[8][9][10] with $90 billion in total franchise revenue.[11][12] The original video game series is the second-best-selling video game franchise (behind Nintendo's Mario franchise)[13] with more than 368 million copies sold[14] and one billion mobile downloads,[15] and it spawned a hit anime television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation[16] with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 169 countries.[14] In addition, the Pok\u00e9mon franchise includes the world's top-selling toy brand,[17] the top-selling trading card game[18] with over 30.4 billion cards sold,[14] an anime film series, a live-action film, books, manga comics, music, merchandise, and a theme park. The franchise is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series, where various Pokemon characters are playable.\r\n\r\nIn November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pok\u00e9mon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pok\u00e9mon representation agreement. The Pok\u00e9mon Company International oversees all Pok\u00e9mon licensing outside Asia.[19] In 2006, the franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary.[20] In 2016, the Pok\u00e9mon Company celebrated Pok\u00e9mon's 20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50 in January and re-releasing the first Pok\u00e9mon video games 1996 Game Boy games Pok\u00e9mon Red, Green (only in Japan), and Blue, and the 1998 Game Boy Color game Pok\u00e9mon Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS on February 26, 2016.[21][22] The mobile augmented reality game Pok\u00e9mon Go was released in July 2016.[23] The first live-action film in the franchise, Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu, based on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS spin-off game Detective Pikachu, was released in 2019.[8]\r\n\r\nThe most recently released core series games, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, were released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.[24] Pok\u00e9mon is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2021, teasing a very special celebration.[25]", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxQ7lCxlLRceGuQ3jd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-04T06:34:31Z", "author": "Creative Studio", "text": "trash", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwnozUjLpsfM3LvUOd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-04T00:28:57Z", "author": "CHILD TOUCHER", "text": "I recomment using visual studio code", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwF2z1cLaBTmcoxWmh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-04T00:20:18Z", "author": "Awoy montilla", "text": "Thanks a lot bro \ud83d\ude05", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwK1bYETpTNcUj1Rdp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-03T20:34:39Z", "author": "Maliha Ahmed", "text": "Well since I'm home and bored, I will teach myself how to make a website using this video!

One issue I faced was when I wanted to link the page 3 (located in a separate folder within the website folder) back to the index page and page 2. Which took me a while to do because he only explained half of it, which is understandable because there was a lot to cover. But apart from that, the tutorial overall is very simple and super easy to comprehend, even for absolute beginners (like myself). I am able to make a basic website from scratch, but I do need some more practice as I have to refer back to this video wherever I forget how to write a piece of code. Now I shall go and watch his CSS tutorials so I can make a real website!

I was impressed with your teaching an d persona. When I finished my website, I learned how much it would cost me for the ugly inflexible site I would have and said, No way. I purchased  HTML & CSS  by Jon Duckett, which has over a thousand positive reviews. I got through the html part and was starting the css section. I got stuck on something and looking on Utube, I found the CSS for beginners series. I was amazed at how cool my mock website was looking in only a week of learning. The padding and borders with 3-D effects are midnight to high noon compared to the content mgmt crap I almost bought, and this is just less than a month since I bought the text books. ....I was up to around lesson 50 in CSS for beginners. Good teacher he is. I was starting to get lost at that point. Partly because I wasn't just using his example and copy pasting. I was following his basic outline and typing the code myself. I figured it would be a better way to learn. But I was getting to the point where some things weren't working, such as using a mailbox image for when I hover over a certain button. I'm also having a hard time with terminology. Names of people, places and things has been a serious weak point for me since childhood and ive usually been able to fake my way through things, However, with this, I am finding terminology extremely important to follow along with both book and vid. So, I decided to go back to lesson 1 of CSS. I think I know pretty much enough to build the simple website I need to sell the books I write if I refer to the book or vids when I get stuck ( I also have the matching Java script and query text book by the same author). But, ya know what? Learning this, while challenging, really is fun. It's cool to hit that refresh button after writing some code and seeing what I made. I've already made a page much cooler looking than anything I've seen on the web. I've linked a couple pages I made and also linked to my word press site I've made a audio and video player pages and a form with drop down choices for a customer as well as a link to an email client from the book. I am wondering how connecting to a payment method and a way for customers to download my eBooks is going to work. So, I want to learn more. Much more. And I want to learn the basics better and have a real firm grasp of HTML before returning to CSS and dabling in Java and possibly Query ( I have no idea what they involve yet)  I'm glad I stumbled upon this tutorial because right off you stressed terminology and so far you are explaining it well. I feel confident when I finish this, I will be much better prepared to go back to CSS. Thanks in advance and I'll comment again as we progress.
