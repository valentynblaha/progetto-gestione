Just a simple example: when you do the Joi setup, you use a switch statement on the output of Joi's error object to give user feedback.  It would be a better learning experience if their were some way you could encourage students to delve into the error message and documentation for ourselves at this point, rather than just immediately providing the properly structured response.
