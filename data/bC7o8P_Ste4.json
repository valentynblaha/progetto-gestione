You could learn C for example). And after that begin to learn algorithms and data structures. Do not dive in those topics directly . First go and explore the thing that you want to learn. First off learn common simple algorithm like swaping 2 numbers(You might know it already), gcd algorithm, Just really basic stuffs. And then day by day learn a little bit more. Try to find problems and solve them in any language you know how to code. Basically , get good at problem solving.The best skill you can get is having  good problems solving skills. \u0130 can talk about programming for hours. This is just a beginning. There is a long way to go, man. Last but not least Do not ever stop learning. Programming is not about smartness. Yeah, smart people can program well, they might code well.
