Se n\u00e3o lhe foi o corpo dilacerado pelos golpes do algoz, foi seu bendito cora\u00e7\u00e3o\ntranspassado pela Paix\u00e3o de seu Filho.

What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \"Linux\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

Just wanted to test it out (not my first go at testing it out, but this one was where I achieved some positive results), to see if it's user-friendly, and also wanted to find out whether it is hard to do stuff via Terminal commands. All and all, it turned out to be a relatively easy OS to learn (I used Mint for a month and then switched to Ubuntu for the remaining 4+ months (which, by some people's accounts, isn't that friendly to newcomers into the Linux world)).\n\nAnyway, once I got tired of doing nothing on it, I decided to reinstall Win10, but here I had a problem where I didn't have a secondary PC nor a disc with an OS. I started searching for a method that would allow me to reinstall Windows without using hardware on the side. I searched for answers and couldn't find a damn thing until 3 days ago I stumbled upon an article that went into details on how to reinstall the Win10 while using Linux distro. And the thing that saved my ass was Grub (+ GParted). Before I found out about this godsend of software, my only hope was to buy another PC, or a Win10 disc (which I didn't want to do since I already had a Win10 license key).\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my experience with this amazing life-saver GRUB!\nSidenote: if you end up doing the same, make sure to not create a grub folder inside the boot folder of a win10 flash drive. Let GRUB do its thing, it'll create that folder on its own. I did the wrong thing by first creating the folder myself and only then running GRUB and it didn't end well (I'm guessing it's sensitive to who's creating the folder, where it must be the software itself and not you; the tutorial didn't go into details on that one). So, I had to delete the folder, run GRUB again, and after it was done, I created the grub.cfg file with copy/pasted text inside of it, and voila, I'm now on Win10 OS.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "shatandv", "text": "freeCodeCamp is reading my mind, this is exactly what I need!
