But I kind of dislike the idea of \"senior of developer\". I mean.... I recognise that activities are craft and value getting better at a craft, but I'm suspicious that the notion of a senior developer creates a system of \"knowledge\" where there is none.\n\nI guess that's what I don't like really, senior X's know about Y, when we have no idea what Y is. It feels a bit like pseudoknowledge.\n\nI suppose I should think about what expertise consists of. I would define this as being cognizant of and having critiqued the cutting edge of a field both practically and theoretically. Of course, the problem with software development is that is quiet broad, and the probably with \"business function\" is that businesses, social groups, and individuals are quite heterogenous.", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugz3c5r0XEPdHg0OozZ4AaABAg.932UOA3OBUu9ABOJwKejl1", "publishedAt": "2020-06-22T00:15:58Z", "author": "Edgar Nova", "text": "I also do not like the concept of a senior developer, but I would say that when you have a little bit of experience developing, and you start to work actively to make your products easier to maintain, have better performance, and learning and applying better practices, you are no longer a \"junior\" developer.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwiiSfKmniHuAaoqfd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-09-19T17:47:15Z", "author": "Anand Undavia", "text": "\"how long is a string\" is the developer's version of  \"what is the age of the captain\".\n\nFor someone looking for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_captain", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgymJ0uyE0N1SXYQidl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-09-19T17:22:40Z", "author": "Sergey Vlasov", "text": "Who talks?
