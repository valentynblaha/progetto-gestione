{"video": {"id": "MpGLUVbqoYQ", "title": "Learn Webpack - Full Tutorial for Beginners", "description": "Learn Webpack from Colt Steele in this full tutorial course.  It begins with a simple question: \"What is webpack?\"  Quickly we move on to installing Webpack, configuring it, and adding loaders for CSS, SASS, HTML, and Files.  The course covers cache busting, setting up a dev server, and splitting up your development and production config files. We incorporate multiple Webpack plugins including clean-webpack-plugin, mini-css-extract-plugin,  optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin, terser-webpack-plugin, and html-webpack-plugin.

I watched a tutorial that showed me how to start a project, then they just left me without any more information so now I was able to get to the point where this program, Vite, will give me the file that webpack would give someone using that. I am actually doing exactly what you are saying, putting the function that takes care of the hovering onto a separate js file because from the error message it gave me when I tried to run the build, it said \"some chunks are larger than 500kb\" and it skipped that file. I assume it was my javascript code. \nI have put that function there.

Though you might have a function inside the first if statement that does the clicking of the object and another function in the if statement for hovering on the object, etc. Then you might want to call those functions in different places so to not repeat the code again (DRY principle).\nFrom what you're describing it sounds like this 3d scene would be one \"component\"/file (as modern JS frameworks) call it with multiple functions inside it. These functions would execute your hovering and clicking actions but would only have the scope (be able to be triggered) in that component/file.\nIf I were you I would stick all the code for that 3d scene into the same file with different functions. But for example,  if you wanted to create a separate page that would allow you to draw something, I would then put that code into a separate file.\nI would recommend looking at Vue or React JS frameworks if you want to understand why webpack would be useful, though I would strongly recommend following a web development roadmap that guides you through the basics first", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Mac Cast", "text": "@Liam Sarsfield i already finished making my website though.

Another big step required to master this as well.\r\nAnother step would also be to understand the why and how of source maps.\r\n\r\nSome comments:\r\n1/ I noticed css-loader is not strictly necessary for me, before style-loader which injects into the DOM (on a project using no sass but post-css to have modern CSS compatible with IE). However, strangely, MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader requires it.\r\n2/ Speaking about vendor.js, I was surprised we need to explicitly install dependencies (such as jquery and popper) to make bootstrap work. It looks it kind of defeats dependency management which primary purpose is to handle this. My hope is this need is limited to first tear of dependencies not the whole tree when many dependencies are involved.\r\n3/ In the production configuration, HtmlWebpackPlugin was inserted in the optimization section. It works. However seems more logical for me to place it in the plugins section. It works too.\r\n\r\nFinally, thank you for this fantastic video. It has it all.
