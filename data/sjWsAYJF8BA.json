I wish I had started here in learning ReasonML instead of the mishmash of tutorials and even a couple of books where things were explained much less clearly than they are here.\n\nWith that said, I friggin' HATE the pipe-first operator. No other ML-like functional language uses it and if you want to write ReasonML to compile to native binaries you can't use it. It's a horrible design decision and, while I understand why it was created, it's still an awful idea that destroys what for me is one of the main benefits of ReasonML - being able to use typed, functional programming for both compiling to JavaScript and to bytecode for the OCaml VM or native binaries as part of the same codebase with shared code between the two domains. I see myself using something like Tablecloth a lot, which abstracts over both the Belt library for compiling to JS and the Jane Street Core library for compiling to native so you can use the same code for both.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyRJDFt3b7v8UZjDN14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-02-15T17:40:54Z", "author": "voidmind", "text": "Very good course!
