Just want to point out one thing: it is not recommended to \"share\" value, i.e, memory, in multiprocessing procedure, because it is relatively inefficient to try to access a data from the RAM by different processors at the same time. In order to maximize the ability of the multiprocessing technique, you'll usually split a relatively large dataset into subsets, and hand each of the subsets to different processors and squeeze out all the calculation resource per processor to do whatever complex calculating process you want for the dataset, and finally merge all the sub-results back into the overall result (this is also why people say multiprocessing is for CPU-bound task). Therefore, using \"Lock\" for avoiding race conditions is actually \"mimicking\" threading behavior.\n\nThat being said, the multiprocessing module provides several data-exchange methods if your \"data sharing\" situation is actually for cross-process communication, or update a global factor for the rest of the processor to use.\n\nThere are a lot of details in the documentation of the python multiprocessing module, I basically just rephrase them with adding some of my experience in using these techniques in real life.

HTML/CSS have nothing to do with Python, while JavaScript does have slightly similar syntax to Python, so it doesn't matter what order you learn it in. I know many people who started with HTML/CSS/JS and then moved on to Python. I myself started with Python and then moved on to HTML/CSS/JS. It really doesn't matter that much. I learnt them side by side (but started with Python) as well a bit. Learning HTML and CSS you can do whenever, but I suggest you do Python/JS before HTML/CSS, because many core programming concepts are in those two languages, versus HTML/CSS, which are only used in the web and have 0 logic. Therefore, I think you should learn either Python or JavaScript before the other two. I would suggest JavaScript, because the syntax is a lot like many other languages, while Python has quite unique syntax. If you learn JS first, you'll have 0 problems with Python. If you learn Python first, you may come across difficulties with JS. Therefore, my final answer is:\n\n1. Learn JS\n2. Learn Python\n3. Learn HTML\n4.

This is an intermediate Python course, so you need to know the basic Python course (I'd recommend the one by Mike Dane's Giraffe Academy on this channel). HTML and CSS are worth learning for web development and design, as it's really useful. JavaScript is incredibly useful on the web as it makes the website actually do something, as it determines the behaviour of the website, while HTML defines the content of the website, and CSS how it looks (styling). JS is now useful outside of browsers and the web as well, with the creation of Node.js around 10 years ago, which seems to be the successor to Java (The most popular language for a long time). I suggest you check out a bit about Node.js.
