It worked fine with SQLite3.  I tried again using PostgreSQL and received the following error:\n\ninsert into \"users\" (\"created_at\", \"email\", \"password\", \"updated_at\", \"username\") values ($1, DEFAULT, DEFAULT, $2, DEFAULT) returning \"id\" - null value in column \"username\" violates not-null constraint\n\nMy code is:\n\nclass UserController {\n    async register({ request }) {\n        const { email, password } = request.all();\n        await User.create({\n            email,\n            password,\n            username: email,\n        });\n        return this.login(...arguments);\n    }\n};\n\nAny ideas?
