Pretty straightforward.\n  The next step is to take 2 to the power of whatever place it is, a 2 to the 0, 2 to the 1, all the way up to the largest placeholder.\n  Then, all we have to do is fill in some mathamatical blanks by completing the exponential 2 problems.\n  If there is a 1, we keep that number (the two to the exponent solution) and add it to other \\1\\ or \\on\\ numbers.\n  If it's a 0, we disregard it.\n  In this video, our number adds up to 75.", "duration": "PT1M42S", "likes": 0, "views": "56955"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Samo Zin", "text": "#04", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Kevin V\u00e9lez", "text": "Great.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Krrrimmi", "text": "Computer Architecture 1.\nI miss my college life. \ud83e\udd13", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "B K", "text": "So here two different binary codes can result in the same number?", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "APPUU EVERYWHERE", "text": "2 to power of 0 will be 0 na how can it b one??", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "try it out!", "text": "That's interesting!", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tun\u00e7 \u00d6nc\u00fc", "text": "Good Job", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "omar attia elserafy", "text": "are there  any more lessons for her", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rajveer Rajveer", "text": "Very nice", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sam", "text": "LOL.
