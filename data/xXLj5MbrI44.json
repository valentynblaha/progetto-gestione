Pretty straightforward.\n  The next step is to take 2 to the power of whatever place it is, a 2 to the 0, 2 to the 1, all the way up to the largest placeholder.\n  Then, all we have to do is fill in some mathamatical blanks by completing the exponential 2 problems.\n  If there is a 1, we keep that number (the two to the exponent solution) and add it to other \\1\\ or \\on\\ numbers.\n  If it's a 0, we disregard it.\n  In this video, our number adds up to 75.", "duration": "PT1M42S", "likes": 0, "views": "58570"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyxWUgXcbM1jiOBOPN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-21T18:53:03Z", "author": "SALVATOR69", "text": "https://media.tenor.com/QCwNWO7A-k4AAAAM/nice-noice.gif", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyPu5R4-SyGW9M23kp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-21T18:52:39Z", "author": "SALVATOR69", "text": "Noice", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz4v_3WS-BW2GWwW8Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-30T19:52:42Z", "author": "Samo Zin", "text": "#04", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxsR3X6yRu-lV1vp-N4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-05T01:23:41Z", "author": "Kevin V\u00e9lez", "text": "Great.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxpjHHE0CfYcZO3x2V4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-07T12:33:10Z", "author": "Krrrimmi", "text": "Computer Architecture 1.\nI miss my college life. \ud83e\udd13", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzSVByL_BLXSWt_Lsl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-24T17:59:37Z", "author": "B K", "text": "So here two different binary codes can result in the same number?", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyNtOGjJE02mEFtC8N4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-12-18T10:45:55Z", "author": "APPUU EVERYWHERE", "text": "2 to power of 0 will be 0 na how can it b one??", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwrPGETgawupHVLqyh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-19T06:38:43Z", "author": "try it out!", "text": "That's interesting!", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzgoT-qx4R-DYIKhAJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-07T15:24:09Z", "author": "Tun\u00e7 \u00d6nc\u00fc", "text": "Good Job", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx-tjDrkfoAtNVW6pt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-12T17:58:33Z", "author": "omar attia elserafy", "text": "are there  any more lessons for her", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzK29PtD9adT-C7P1B4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-09-16T16:18:53Z", "author": "Rajveer Rajveer", "text": "Very nice", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgynoP4br6dt9_U_1al4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-06-20T02:12:46Z", "author": "Sam", "text": "LOL.
