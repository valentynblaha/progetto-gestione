I fixed it in this way:\nFirstly, I created this function so that code is not repeated in both delete and save operations\ndef refresh_saved_beats_file():\n    with open('saved_beats.txt', 'w') as f:\n        for i in range(len(saved_beats)):\n            f.write(str(saved_beats[i]))\n\nThen, I modified the delete operation :\nif delete_button.collidepoint(event.pos):\n    if 0 <= index < len(saved_beats):\n        saved_beats.pop(index)\n    refresh_saved_beats_file()\n\nIf you are curious, save operation ended up in this way:\nif saving_button.collidepoint(event.pos):\n    saved_beats.append(f'\\nname: {beat_name}, beats: {beats}, bpm: {bpm}, selected: {clicked}')\n    refresh_saved_beats_file()\n    save_menu = False\n    typing = False\n\nThere are many other things that can be improved, but that's up to you, these two respond to a failure in the functionality of the app", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Aaron Lynott", "text": "Really dumb question - following along and ensuring that I understand the code as I write it along with you.
