We would hash the password, HOWEVER it would not persist in your SQLite database. This causes comparePassword to compare a simple string like 'passwordlol' (which was saved in the database because the hooks aren't persisting the correct hash password) to '2vh$@/30d@#%$%^@..' which are not equal. \n\nTHE SOLUTION: Instead, hash the password in your AuthenticationController.js file before it is sent to the User model for creation. This way the Model saves the hashed password to the database and therefore it persists and comparisons become equal leading to everything working.
