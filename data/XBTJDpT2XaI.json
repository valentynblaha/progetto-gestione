And that is the quality of the AUDIO. Some below have critiqued the instructor's accent, which isn't great even for native English speakers. The most difficult part for understanding, however, is the flatness of his intonation. Some of that can be solved with post production audio processing, but mostly it can only be solved by having someone deliver the content who is a skilled presenter no matter the language of instruction. For a good example, look at any popular tech youtube channel. The speaker never has flat intonation, they always modulate their voice and tone which assists in comprehension. There are many with heavy accents who do well because they know how to present spoken words! As this video stands, I have to focus hard on the code to merely comprehend what \"ay-ray\" means. Whereas \"uh-RAY\" is immediately recognizable.
