{"video": {"id": "KTFFdZSDiTU", "title": "WebGPU Tutorial - Advanced Graphics on the Web Course", "description": "In this course, you will learn the basics of WebGPU. WebGPU is the next-generation graphics API and future Web standard for graphics and compute. This two-hour video contains 10 WebGPU projects. We create each project based on the previous one from scratch and demonstrate how to add 3D graphics to your web applications.\n\nAll the projects presented in this video were taken from Dr. Xu's book \"Practical WebGPU Graphics\". Please visit his website at https://drxudotnet.com for more WebGPU examples.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course developed by Dr. Jack Xu.
