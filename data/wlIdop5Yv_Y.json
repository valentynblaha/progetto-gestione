Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers\u2014ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are.\n\nWhat is Contentful?\n\nContentful provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.\n\n\ud83d\udd17View more great tutorials from Khaled: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_XsS8kgD9Y64ZOug4YKhpw\n\n\ud83d\udc26Khaled on Twitter: https://twitter.com/khaled_garbaya\n\n\ud83d\udd17Check out https://howtocontentful.com to learn more about Contentful\n\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com", "duration": "PT1H8M42S", "likes": "300", "views": "25992"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxsB0QbvVJ2bnOnBsJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-27T19:25:28Z", "author": "Kendall Hayes", "text": "Still relevant for 2020?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw7dtYAxsvR8xPcnIB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-20T18:26:43Z", "author": "Instinctual Beasts", "text": "Yeah I heard that fart at 3:48", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugw7dtYAxsvR8xPcnIB4AaABAg.91ZjEaZhcT49Jf1yHb1vBA", "publishedAt": "2021-02-12T14:39:39Z", "author": "Erwin Mesias", "text": "Me too!
