The \u201ccheat sheets\u201d and graphics (of for example the support plans) are very helpful too, as is the final section where similar-ish sections get compared. If you watch this video and thoroughly study the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials module on AWS Skillbuilder, you\u2019ve already covered a lot. \n\nHaving said that \u2014 it\u2019s best to check out the most recent exam guide on the AWS website too and carefully read through the possible topics mentioned as not all of those topics are covered by this video and the training module. I made the mistake of kind of slacking on that and encountered some material in the exam that was in a \u201cblind spot\u201d for me.

I mention this to provide context to some of the following thoughts:\n1.) This video is def helpful. Most of the material is still relevant. But it's not exhaustive. Plenty new AWS services not covered in this video. Unless one has an IT background, it's hard for me to see folks passing based solely on this particular study resource (maybe just sliding by). I took practice exams & read study material from a couple other sources.  2-3 questions were exact copies from sample exams, another 2-3 slight variations.  Extremely helpful.  If you want to ensure you pass on the first shot, and want to do so confidently, seek out other resources in addition to this vid.\n\n2.) I studied appx. 3-4 hours a day for 4 consecutive days.  Another 1-hr review on Day 5, just before the test.  That's 13-17 hrs total.  My background - Data Scientist, grad degree, more quant & tech-adjacent than IT. Folks of similar background (i.e. non-IT quant/analytical/dev) I'd ballpark would need somewhere around 15-30 hours total to have a good probability of passing. Non-IT/non-quant/non-dev...definitely more.\n\n3.). Read the Q's carefully. Often 2 choices seem equally accurate upon a cursory read. So don't just gloss over the wording...read it carefully. The phrasing & specific choice of diction can mean the difference b/w a right & wrong answer. \n\nHope folks find this helpful.", "likes": 6}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jon Plaud", "text": "Some fo this needs updating since everything has been changed on AWS.

I reviewed over and over again, but the exam is still very challenging to me. But doing sample questions and reviewing did help, otherwise I am pretty sure I will get a much lower score...\n\n3. The result will not come out right a way(**maybe I was wrong, based on aws website, it will tell u if u pass right a way)  official result will take up to 5 business days... 5 mins before the exam is due. PSI will prompt if u need extra time or quit since it has been 90 mins(sth like that), I think it was weird since I had 5 mins left but I had finished it already. When u click quit, the whole PSI browser will be closed. I have heard that some people who finished the exam early and left, the submission of their exam got disapproved since they left without letting the proctor knew, either PSI or Pearson I am not sure....\n\nI hope I can pass thou!

Spent 3 days studying for it and took the exam on a saturday morning. got 82%! Just wanted to add my two cents here, this cert while considered basic can be difficult depending on your current knowledge background. I studied and am currently in IT so many of the concepts I am familiar. However, if you are from business or something non-IT, I would recommend that you take a month to study for this. Many concepts mentioned are high level and may fly over your heads because you weren't paying attention or just don't understand it enough to deduce the correct answer. E.g. the difference between different kinds of databases. For developers, once you learn the difference, its pretty hard to forget. You will instinctively choose the right one. But that may not be the case for a non-techie. So difficulty will vary but dont be discouraged!\n\nFor more general tips, after watching and reviewing this video, please go ahead and search for exam dumps/ questions online they will really help clarify your misunderstandings. A lot of questions in my exam focused on CloudTrail, Responsibilies of a cloud provider / customer *** vey impt. You really need to know each of the Amazon Technology listed. E.g. CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Amazon Macie, Route53. I would recommend pausing the video when you reach a new technology, go to the Amazon page, read up the description, then return back to this video to verify and reinforce your understanding. \n\nYou need to know what metrics are available in budgets vs TCO, SNS, MFA and IAM, Pricing models, consolidated billing ( i had 4 questions on this), trusted advisor.\n\nA few technologies were mentioned that weren't covered in the video and I'm not sure if it was the correct answer or not;\nAmazon Fireeye\nAmazon Cognito (3 questions mentioned this)\n\nOverall, this video definitely helped + Harsh Baxi's Time Stamps for the topics + examtopics AWS certified cloud practitioner (This is the \"forum\" exam dump that helped me immensely)\nI think i would have failed without the questions from examtopics.\n\nHope this helps! good luck everyone!", "likes": 37}, "replies": [{"author": "Cloud MadeEasy", "text": "Flow my course for latest question answer of AWS SAA-C02", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Psycho", "text": "thank you!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "yoon", "text": "Many thanks for your long comment!

If you have no experience in IT, it will be very difficult to get a job immediately as a solutions architect unless its some fresh graduate program where they are willing to train up hires with no background. The reason is because the cloud is a very large encompassing area of different topics. Networking, security, sysadmin, development. If you don't have experience, it's hard to pick up on the job because people will be coming to you with their problems and their current setups and you as the architect will have to try and create a map that will help them navigate their transition to the cloud.\n\nWhat you can do, is look at it long term and do a tier list. \nTier 1:\nLearning goal: get a couple of IT certs. AWS is a big jump, but look more at basic certs that will solidify your fundamentals like Comptia Network+, Security+, Cisco CCNA. Because those are also common interview questions. The certs show that you understand the knowledge, and also put your position across to the recruiter that you are serious about moving into IT.\n\nCareer Goal: You can try applying for cloud associate jobs, but it will probably be tough. Expand your search criteria and first try to get a job in IT. Thats 50% of the battle won. Associate sysadmin roles, network admins, security analysts. Moving from 1 of these roles to the next cloud job will be much easier because you will have the knowledge + its a simple transition for recruiters looking to hire. The best advice  that I can give and I wish I knew about before I started working would be to look for large MNCs that you know use the cloud. Typically, even if they are just hiring for non-cloud positions - e.g. linux engineer, etc. - you will more than likely have a chance to work with the cloud. That'll be a big boost to your CV as well.\n\nTier 2: \nGet your dream cloud job with your experience.\n\ntldr; Cert up (to pass HR checks), know basic networking, having a homelab is really good, know 1 scripting language (e.g. python) , land any IT job first.\nRecommended subreddit would be /r/sysadmin\n\nlast tip, dont be overwhelmed by /r/sysadmin. And there are different kinds of cloud jobs. Some sell the cloud (not much actual technical exp required, just understand and sell the package) usually called consultants, you got the architects who design the whole thing, you could cloud engineers, cloud administrators; each title are different job aspects and require different skills. So what i think you can do is rather than using a general statement of \"i want to work with clouds\", go to linkedin and find out what kind of jobs are there in the cloud industry and match what role you want to do, then develop the skills needed for that role.", "likes": 3}, {"author": "Ayman Almateeg", "text": "@I CHENG LIN firstly I admire your braveness, not everyone is brave enough to consider such a drastic career shift so props to you for this. You can do it easily if you stay motivated and while I am no cloud expert I can say you have made a good choice by considering cloud as a future career, it is obviously picking up more more everyday. I think the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate is a good starting point. AWS has a fee essentials training on their webpage that could get you started and you could open a free account and play with their free services to get a feel of what is like. Some learning on basic IT principles could help before (or even after) doing this course, maybe learnt about compute, storage and network resources. You will find that these things will sound more interesting to you and you will want to keep learning. luckily, it is one of the career paths that have abundant support online in terms of learning and certification material, and the AWS platform and certification pathways are very organised.

If I may make 2 quick recommendations for future videos to further strengthen the presentations: \n\n1. I know there is a lot of content to cover in a condensed video. But if you can not end each sentence/phrase with a higher intonation, if would offer the listener a slight, mental breather and signal a brief pause to the material presented. Currently, most sentences \"bounce up\" in octave at the end; ends up sounding as if everything was just 1 really long string of thoughts w/o pause or punctuation. Insert a comma and period in your voice every now and then.\n\n2. Try not to end up sound like Mr. Mackey from South Park.
