Your tutorial was spot on from my perspective and very educational. Your efforts are greatly appreciated!  With having an interest in the node stack but not any real experience, I found your tutorial to be just what I was looking for. You covered all the bases from getting started to finishing up.  \n\nYou had mentioned in part 7,  you would  appreciate any thoughts on how you did and apologized for the presentation and the debugging (you sir have nothing to apologize for).  I really enjoyed the debugging aspect of your presentation and that in itself was an education as well and very valuable to me.  I would not have wanted it to be any other way.  I think, if the coding were sterile I would have gotten far less out of it.   There were only two items I had wished you had touched upon. \n\n- The premise that multiple users were accessing the system and creating tabs.  I am wondering how a person would go about creating an efficient  watcher/middleware, (see I think I know what I am talking about now,  you've created a monster), which would be  aware of song additions and update the songs panel and possibly have a songs added badge which would possibly link to a recently added songs panel. I am most interested in how a person would create the watcher as well as \"what to watch\".  \n\n- How to build and  implement a deployment.\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated in regard to how to go about this.\n\nOnce Again, Thanks So Much for your Efforts !\n\nBest Regards\n\nJC", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyqNqx9AqEeGz5F14Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-01-17T22:28:37Z", "author": "Ismail saja", "text": "if client and server run separately, how we deploy it to the web? is that mean we need to host to webserver separately too?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyqNqx9AqEeGz5F14Z4AaABAg.8bXojKKFLM18dOGG7U6bag", "publishedAt": "2018-03-04T22:28:16Z", "author": "Carlos Roberto", "text": "You can use them in separated port in the same server.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyuVgZKuDfjgQ-jXAR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-01-17T19:31:45Z", "author": "WikyDiky", "text": "The most useful video(s) I've seen in a long time.
