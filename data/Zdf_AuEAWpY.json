Perhaps a dictionary where the key is the number, value is the amount of numbers you see. Then you loop through all pairs, and check your hash table to see if the value exists. to avoid duplicates, you would make the inner loop always start at the index of the outer loop. So youre really only searching from the outer index onward.\n\nanother solution, which is nlogn + n^2 is sort the array. Then loop through the array. For each loop, initalize a high and a low pointer, end of the array and the starting index + 1. If the triplet is greater than 0, you move the high pointer back. If the triplet is less than zero, you move the lower pointer forward, until you find a zero. Stick that in the array, and continue doing this until the low pointer is at the same index as the high, then break the loop and continue.", "likes": 38}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxfWHtLqqHpOMKG6H14AaABAg.8gz8Dnoz2Ag9B7jqlslE_A", "publishedAt": "2020-07-15T10:47:16Z", "author": "willie EkaIndLand", "text": "This  is genius idea, thanks for the inputs u gave me, Sir.
