I\u00b4m developing a metroidvania style game using this to improve my JavaScript knowledge, so far all working well except for an issue with collision detection, so I'm hope for some direction about this. It appears the collision mechanism doesn't work as intended when the player has more width or more height than the tile size, and i don't know why. My player has 12 width, 32 height, and my tile size = 16. Suppose i have a lone block in  air with the size of a tile (16x16). If I try to collide my player to the left side of it while jumping, varying velocity_y while pressing right, the collision will be detected only for the upper an lower ends of the player. If I\u00b4m descending straight down on the left side of the block, pressing right, the player will collide normally with the left side of the block only while the player\u00b4s bottom y is lower than the block bottom y. When passed this Y, the player will move right entering the block area. With the opposite velocity_y (going up) the same thing happens, as soon as the player\u00b4s top pass the tile\u00b4s top the collision is no more detected. Raising the width of the player to greater than the tile size, the same thing happens to the horizontal collisions as well.
