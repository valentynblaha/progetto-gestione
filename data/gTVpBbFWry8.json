I have a question that's kind of hard to explain - but I'll try. I use a laptop for my code, and then an ultrawide monitor for previewing my code. When previewing, I tend to make my window take up about 2 thirds of my monitor. I'll open the developer console and set the width to what I'm working with (1440px, for example). What I've realized is that this looks totally different than if I did this on my laptop, instead of a monitor! For example, when previewing this window at 1440px wide and zoomed in at 100%, I get a height of 845px. When doing the exact same thing on my laptop I get a height of 491px. I've been designing code on my monitor that looks horrendous on most people's laptops, and I've only just realized! Does anyone know a way of working where this won't happen?
