I am new to both C# and Visual Studio 2022 and this amazing tutorial was very easy to follow. Only teeny tiny quibble was trying to follow which CTRL+. that you selected at times because it was done so quickly. There were several times I had to back up a few times and pause to finally catch it!\n\nI do have a question that I think would help many other users as well. How would I create a drop-down choice box on a form that would link to ANOTHER table? I would like to populate the drop-down with table data, not with a static list.\n\nFor example, let's say I have a table called \"Colors\". I want to have a form so that the user can add more colors to this table (it will look just like the sample form you created in this tutorial. That isn't a problem, thanks to you! :)\n\nThen, I would like to use this \"user updated table\" to provide the contents for the dropdown in another form. For example, let's say I have a form for someone to order a t-shirt. I want a drop-down box on the form for someone to pick their desired t-shirt color. The drop-down would go look at my \"Colors\" table and display the list of available color choices. \n\nMeanwhile, that \"Colors\" table would be kept up to date by a company user (so that IT does not have to go in and change the code to add or remove a color) thereby the drop-down would always have the current colors available.\n\nOne other small question to go along with that. How do I get the choices in the drop-down box to display alphabetically? And, how do I get the fields on the forms in your tutorials to display alphabetically?\n\nThanks so much for any and all assistance you can provide!\n\nMelissa", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwG5cUZbTyTGg9iA_54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-30T09:50:33Z", "author": "Khashe", "text": "By far the best Razor introduction course I've seen on Youtube. \nEverything is so concise and well explained.

Now when you run the \u2018add-migration DatAdded\u2019 in your migration folder you will find a new cs file with DateAdded in the name of the file. Now when you open this file, you see an Up and Down method. At this moment, when you check your database table, you don\u2019t see the Date column. Now run update-database, and your Up method will be executed and your table updated. Open your database, open the table and now you see that new column.
