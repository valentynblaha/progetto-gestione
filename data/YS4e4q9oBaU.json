It is much safer to make the concurrency explicit by use of async-await rather than leave it to the scheduler.\nFurthermore, go does not seem to distinguish between threads and processes. In Python, there is the threading module and the multiprocessing module. This distinction tends to be very useful.\nThe scheduler is doing too much in my opinion.

The service receives a Go program, vets, compiles, links, and runs the program inside a sandbox, then returns the output.\n\nIf the program contains tests or examples and no main function, the service runs the tests. Benchmarks will likely not be supported since the program runs in a sandboxed environment with limited resources.\n\nThere are limitations to the programs that can be run in the playground:\n\nThe playground can use most of the standard library, with some exceptions. The only communication a playground program has to the outside world is by writing to standard output and standard error.\nIn the playground the time begins at 2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC (determining the significance of this date is an exercise for the reader). This makes it easier to cache programs by giving them deterministic output.\nThere are also limits on execution time and on CPU and memory usage.\nThe article \"Inside the Go Playground\" describes how the playground is implemented.

So it is good for understanding and working with higher level concepts like AI/machine learning. But c# has very solid frameworks as well like ASP .NET Core and Unity and has a well maintained ecosystem.

I see a lot of beneficial on this language, but I also see some hard to read code (at least in my opinion, may be because I am used to other standard languages), I know this has become the latest standard but it seems to be that with so implicit code abstracted in some functions, if you are not aware of them you are  going to be completely lost on a big source code.

While I obviously can't speak to their specific use case, I can say that Go's garbage collection tooling has been a source of aggressive optimization for a long time now. \n\n\n\nFrom what I understand, Discord was using a fairly old version of Go (1.9?). That was probably the latest version at the time that they decided to move to Rust, but Go's GC tooling has matured a lot since then. Also, from what I understand, Discord was already experimenting with Rust so they might have had more motivation than strictly a performance issue.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say that any language with a garbage collector is probably going to run into a use case where the GC is a liability. In my experience, those situations are exceedingly rare in the real-world, but they do happen. In those cases, changing to a language whose strengths are better aligned to the problem makes total sense.\n\n\nHope that helps!", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw0KTW6D6_UqWYyUqR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-02-07T15:38:02Z", "author": "Joy Tocho", "text": "Nice but not appropriate to a beginner in programming", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugw0KTW6D6_UqWYyUqR4AaABAg.94jqjEQLjYk9IYclEo7IkR", "publishedAt": "2021-01-15T21:04:36Z", "author": "The Exception Handler", "text": "you can watch the complete tutorial about golang, on the below channel\n\nhttps://youtube.com/channel/UCgRrjz7mHwqTQqm6KC4mSBQ", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwrkwqps-IA6HU-fUJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-02-05T01:07:56Z", "author": "Joel Davis", "text": "Really enjoyed this video, might be useful to get to advanced topics like ginkgo, glide, and more on golang project structure.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzDgqc3KQICBj4_Iqd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-02-03T04:57:39Z", "author": "Bryan Lumbantobing", "text": "please make english subtitle in this video even it auto generated . pleas", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxKFRvg_Hg_OX6RmcF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-02-01T10:36:35Z", "author": "S.

Maybe I am exaggerating a little bit the fact that Linux is the best for me, cause a good programmer can do a great job as he has a functional computer, but the way I am seeing the fact that my fellow college students don't even think that command line is needed in software developing, that somehow makes me feel sad.
