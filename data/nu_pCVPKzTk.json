I was forced to work in customer service but kept applying every single day and practicing as well. Just last week a hospital gave me the \u201cyes\u201d after 4 interviews as Web Developer in JS but I\u2019ll also see php, wordpress, drupal from some of their sites, SQL and work on integrations. Yesterday I had a meeting with HR and webt through benefits and all that but when it came to salary they offered 85k. No bonus. I asked if there was room to negotiate, they said yes, then I asked if they can meet me in the middle between 92 to 100k. He told me he\u2019ll speak to others in the company and will let me know and after that he\u2019ll send me some other links for me to fill out. They didn\u2019t reach out to me today, and I\u2019m beginning to worry. I haven\u2019t contacted them yet though. I feel what I asked was reasonable and I was very polite all the time. What do you think? If they do reach back out but said that\u2019s their final offer, as much as I\u2019d want more money I will accept the original offer but how can I say it without losing face and keep some dignity? Should I reach out again, asking the HR guy some other questions related to work and see what happens? For full context, I live in Massachusetts so I still think asking for a little bit of money was reasonable because they want people with experience and I nailed all tech questions and passed their code test but I\u2019m beginning to grow nervous they would ghost me.
