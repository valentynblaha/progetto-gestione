Beacuse : if it's the first answer and google uploaded the same data to all servers, that took more time and take more space.

I also want to say that I took some notes during the course and I think that it will be useful for people who want a recap every once in a while. That said, its still very important to watch this video, in my opinion as I have only a summary of its content. Anyways here you guys go - hope you will find these notes useful!\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      INTERNET\r\n\r\nSwitch\r\nTo connect different computers in an environment together we can use a switch. To connect all the computers to the switch we can use copper wires or fibre optic cables which are faster. Copper wires can be of two types those are CAT-5 and CAT-6. Category 6 is faster than category 5. The switch has ports on them called LAN ports, they are called LAN ports because switches are the ones that help us in creating a LAN.\n\n\n\r\n\r\nAccess points\r\nAccess points are similar to switches but they can be connected to wirelessly.\r\n\r\nOnce connected with these wires this network forms a LAN(local area network) coz it is located in a specific local area. To send data from PC 1 to PC 6 if they are in a network, the computer creates messages in packets and sends it to the switch. The switch then reads the contents of the packet and understands the destination of the package and sends it to the dest in this case PC6.\n\n\r\n\r\nHow do devices connect to the internet\r\nTo create a LAN a switch is fine. But how do devices connect to the internet. For this we use something called a router. The switch is connected to the router with the help of a copper wire. But to actually connect to the internet we use a wire provided by the ISP(internet service provider) for a given price. To send a packet to the internet, the computer first sends it to the switch then the switch sends it to the router and then the router acts like a door to the internet.\r\nEach house or residence will have a LAN. The router helps us in connecting the computer to another computer in the world. In other words the router helps us connect two different LANS together.\n\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the internet?\r\nThe internet helps connect all the LANs together and creates a network. A home router is very important, it is basically a mix of a router and a switch. This typically also has a access point feature so we can connect to it wirelessly.\r\nSo why cant there be just one router and all home routers connect to that router. Well first of all the main router will have to have millions of ports so that each device can connect to it. But the main problem is one router will have to carry all the load making it single point of failure. So in this case if there is a single problem with the router than the internet of the whole world will crash at the same time. Also long cables would be required.\n\n\r\nThese cables to connect to the internet are even laid down on the ocean floor! If one of these cables are broken it can cause the internet of that continent to break. These are all fibre optic cables coz the speed of data transmission is very high.\r\n\r\nSay a computer from India has to send a packet to a computer in Mexico. First the router takes this packet and sends it through cables to another router. This router now has many options to pass this packet forward. To choose the best one it has something called a routing table. The routing table is developed through special algorithms which are created by the processor in the router. It them forwards this packet to the next router based on the routing table. This process of passing the packets is called forwarding. This process repeats until the packet reaches its destination.\r\n\r\nOne important thing to note is that the router always tries to take the shortest path to reach the dest. This may not be the shortest path visually but taking into account many factors like traffic etc. \r\nThe internet is a network of networks.\n\n\r\n\r\nSay youtube wants to transmit data to you after you send a request to it. The way it will do this is it will send packets of data to you through the internet. This sending of data piece by piece is called streaming. When we want this packet from youtube, we are actually communicating with high powered computers from youtube called servers. There are many youtube servers distributed around the world to avoid single point of failure.\n\n\r\n\r\nWAN(Wide area network)\r\nThis is to connect two LANs together. You might be wondering then what is the difference between this and the internet. The main difference is privacy.\r\nAssume one LAN network which is an office wants to send data to another Lan network, well if they do this through the internet then the data can be exploited because the internet is public. So if they are in a LAN then only those local computers can access it and if they are in a WAN then only the two connected LAN networks will be able to access the data as it is private.The most popular WAN network method is called VPN(virtual private network). VPN tunnelling provides a tunnel for data transmission in a public network but also gives you anonymity and is more secure. It encrypts your data packets before sending them. People generally use VPN\u2019s to access restricted websites.\n\n\r\n\r\nHow does VPN tunnelling work?\r\nWell the thing is since there really isn\u2019t a physical tunnel connecting the two LAN routers, the data can still be accessed. But the data is put into a secure envelope per say just like you put a letter in an envelope, this data is then encrypted so data cant be hacked or accessed. Putting the data to be transmitted into an envelope or another packet is called encapsulation.\n\n\r\n\r\nSince the internet is a public network, don\u2019t you think that the data you send to networks like amazon can be hacked?\r\nWell to some extent it can\u2019t be hacked because of something called end to end encryption. In this system only the two communicating users will be able to see the data.\n\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the biggest WAN in the world?\r\nThe biggest WAN in the world is the internet itself. But there is a difference between the WAN connection between two offices and the internet. The internet is public and is owned by everyone in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAN is more secure than WAN because LAN never passes over the internet but WAN even with VPN passes over the internet.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic and Private WAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a private WAN you can buy a line directly from your ISP and use that private line for connection of networks. This is more secure but it can be very costly especially over long distances. That is why average companies generally prefer Public WANS\r\n\r\nWe use switches to create a LAN and routers to create a WAN. We cannot use a switch to create a WAN\n\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the ISP?\r\nThe internet is made up of a connection of many different routers. The routers of the world are connected by these different ISP\u2019s. Each ISP can control specific routers.\t ISP\u2019s are the companies that allow us to connect to the internet. There are many different ISP\u2019s in the world.\n\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL ISP\u2019S\r\nLocal isp\u2019s are responsible for connection of LANS in a locality. These local isps then connect to the regional ISP. So we can say that different local ISPs connect together in a regional ISP. We can say that local isps connect localities like neighbourhoods and Regional ISP\u2019s connect cities in a country. So a network of the country is formed by regional and local ISPs. Global ISPs connects different countries systems together.  \r\n\r\nNote : some Local ISP\u2019s can interact with global isps without regional ISPs\r\nLocal ISP\u2019s are generally smaller companies and they sometimes may want a direct connection with a global ISP so that there customers can have a better experience\r\n\r\nSay a computer in Belgium wants to connect to a website in India but that website has only one server. In this case the user sends a request and the packet moves through the local ISP and regional ISP and global ISP to reach the server of the website. This website then sends the response with all relevant information. The path taken by the request and response can be different as these paths are never fixed. A company like google is very different from this random company. It has servers all around the world, so that its customers can get faster speeds. But sometimes even google faces some slight problems with speed and can dissatisfy its customers. But, google has a good solution for this. This solution is peering.\n\n\r\n\r\nIn peering, googles servers establish a direct connection with our local ISP\u2019s neglecting the need of an ISP infrastructure, This also increases the security.\r\nSo we can say that googles fast service speed is because of its distributed servers and peering infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible for us to connect directly to a regional ISP for faster connection.", "likes": 155}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxwpDH6a3oIstunjs94AaABAg.9QcYT_M_Xw49ady3VKXMTq", "publishedAt": "2022-05-05T14:02:39Z", "author": "Reddit Galaxy", "text": "I'm at school and i have signed in to say thank you very much for this if anyone sees this in the future please reply to my message so when i have made my own version i can also comment it here so people  can chose", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxwpDH6a3oIstunjs94AaABAg.9QcYT_M_Xw49Vstrv6g0YE", "publishedAt": "2021-12-13T06:06:14Z", "author": "Faiza Abdul Rasheed", "text": "Thank you so much dude for this", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxwpDH6a3oIstunjs94AaABAg.9QcYT_M_Xw49VkAGERBPp6", "publishedAt": "2021-12-09T20:45:04Z", "author": "Anikait Singh", "text": "Thank You!", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxwpDH6a3oIstunjs94AaABAg.9QcYT_M_Xw49Ve2C_8jG-x", "publishedAt": "2021-12-07T11:39:13Z", "author": "Mohamed Kamel", "text": "Thank you \rAnanthram Vijayaraj,  truly appreciate the time you spent highlighting the most important terms that came up in this course  \nand thanks Mr Beau Carnes, a wonderful lecture yet again", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxwpDH6a3oIstunjs94AaABAg.9QcYT_M_Xw49VMaoN2ZFdu", "publishedAt": "2021-11-30T07:44:47Z", "author": "Preeti Sharma", "text": "Thanks", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxYrXi65B4t--CruH94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-04T14:34:06Z", "author": "Symbiotic Parasite", "text": "This is going straight to HR.....
