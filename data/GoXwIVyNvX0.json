I use it as a repititorium for test preparation. One thing I noticed tough is, you said that with \"==\" used on two object, you check if they are the same object. I think the \"==\" only checks if the two objects have the same reference variable in the stack (so \"bill\" and \"joe\" in this case). Since they have different reference variables \"==\" returns false. If you wanted to check if they are actually the same object in the heap, you'd have to use the \".equals\" method like bill.equals(joe).
