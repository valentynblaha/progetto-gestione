{"video": {"id": "j5Zsa_eOXeY", "title": "DevOps Engineering Course for Beginners", "description": "What is DevOps in the context of software engineering? Learn all about DevOps in this comprehensive course for beginners with three technical tutorials. You will learn what DevOps is, continuous integration, continuous deployment strategies, and application performance management. Many DevOps practices are commonly used in programming and web development, it is important to understand key terms and technologies. \n\nThis course often references the MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS) technology stack. You will get a series of talks with technology recommendations based on these best practices. There will be several programming examples embedded in these talks. As long as you know the absolute basics of coding and the web, you'll have no problem following along. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Notes \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 1: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-devops/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 2: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-test-driven-development/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 3: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-ci/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 4: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-code-coverage/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 5: https://layerci.com/blog/linting-best-practices/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 6: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-an-ephemeral-environment/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 7: https://layerci.com/blog/the-difference-between-vms-and-containers/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 8: https://layerci.com/blog/what-are-rolling-deployments/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 9: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-a-blue-green-deployment/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 10: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-autoscaling/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 11: https://layerci.com/blog/service-discovery/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 12: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-log-aggregation/\n\ud83d\udd17 Lesson 13: https://layerci.com/blog/vital-production-metrics/\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Content: 3 Pillars of DevOps \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Unit 1 - Code Review Automation\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 1  What is DevOps?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 2 - What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 3 - What is Continuous Integration (CI)? w/ CI setup TUTORIAL\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 4 - What is code coverage? \n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 5 - Linting best practices\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 6 - Ephemeral environments  w/ setup TUTORIAL\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Unit 2 - Deployment Strategies\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 7 - Virtual Machines (VMs) vs. Containers \n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 8 - Rolling deployments  \n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 9 - Blue/green deployments w/ Continuous Deployment setup TUTORIAL\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 10 - What is autoscaling?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 11 - What is service discovery? \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Unit 3 - Application Performance Management (APM)\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 12 - What is log aggregation?\n\u2328\ufe0f Lesson 13 - Vital production metrics \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Reddit Discussion Forum: https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsacademy/\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created and narrated by Colin Chartier, Co-founder and CEO at LayerCI\n\ud83d\udc26 Have feedback on the course?

For example you can't run windows container on linux os but you can run windows and linux containers on windows os because windows kernel natively will support windows containers and linux containers will be supported through WSL that's why you have to enable it. same reason why you can't run MacOS container on the same. \n\nVMs on the other hand, emulate entire OS, so that includes kernel. hence you're able to run windows and/or MacOS VMs on Linux. containers share the same kernel of the host OS so it's not possible.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ad FLoRiN", "text": "thanks for the free content. highly appreciated, but can you get a better mic ?\ncheers", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Vision33r", "text": "Containers are simply siloed VM stack that only take API pipelines vs a VM that has to OS overhead and the API pipelines together.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "ziat _ziat", "text": "and what about the CD?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Todd T", "text": "Nice stuff but that module operator line of code has me scratching my head. \n\n\u201cIf (i%50==49)\u2026\u201d, you say will run if i >=49?

There are many possible ways to build quality.

Yet in an agile team you find everyone contributes to build understanding about what is being built in a feature or story.  So everyone on the team is thus responsible for Quality.
