I'd suggest looking through the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network that we discussed in the first video) to familliarize yourself with the sheer amount and general potential for the methods that exist. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Methods_Index\n\nExamples include '.split(' ')', which will turn a string into an array and can do so in many different ways. Methods are powerful - many times when you want your script to do something, there's a method for that. \n\nFunctions, like variables, are something you define and create. During your bonfires, you will create functions that take a certain piece of information and manipulate it in whatever way you choose. You'll become more familliar with syntax there, but for now, just remember that with methods and functions you can do almost anything with your code.", "duration": "PT51S", "likes": "91", "views": "10851"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyBhCeImqIZvYOMiiR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-16T05:56:11Z", "author": "Anumeha Ayushi", "text": "If you don't find an existing method\n...create a function....short and simple explanation.
