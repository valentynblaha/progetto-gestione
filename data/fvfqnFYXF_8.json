Other than that, most of the content in this video remains accurate.\n\nInfo and mini-lesson on the 'Profiles' tab of Chrome Dev Tools. Check out more in-depth documentation here: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/profile-performance/rendering-tools/js-execution\n\n The Profiles panel lets you profile the execution time and memory usage of a web app or page. This primarily applies to the JavaScript running on your page or app. \n\nThere are three types of profiles you can collect: CPU profile, HEAP snapshot, and HEAP profile. HEAP profiles have more to do with memory usage, while a CPU profile has more to do with JavaScript performance. \n\nA profiler called V8 is used while your code runs to pinpoint what in the JavaScript takes the most time, making it easy to optimize your code.\n\nEach of these profiles can be viewed on the left, and you can take multiple profiles of each. Overall, the profiles tab is helpful when optimizing code.", "duration": "PT3M20S", "likes": "93", "views": "14741"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "A Q", "text": "It's 5 years old.
