I was trying to define a function which would update a table. What I did is:\n\ndef update_table(before, after):\r\n\t'''Updates the table, chaging the record with the keyword \"before\" for \"after\" '''\r\n\r\n\r\n\tconn = sqlite3.connect('customer.db')\r\n\tc = conn.cursor()\n\n\r\n\r\n\tc.execute(\"UPDATE customers SET last_name = ? WHERE last_name = ?\", (before, after))\n\n\r\n\r\n\tconn.commit()\r\n\tconn.close()\n\nBut it doesn't do anything. What can I do? I've also tried without the parenthesis in the execute command and it doesn't work either:\n\n\tc.execute(\"UPDATE customers SET last_name = ? WHERE last_name = ?\", before, after)", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwZam7Q-K-JOsl5PDZ4AaABAg.9QqBhK2Gcbb9QqBrPbaBif", "publishedAt": "2021-08-09T22:17:29Z", "author": "Jorge Nu\u00f1ez", "text": "BTW, on the other file I wrote:\n\ndatabase.update_table('Elder', 'Elder S')", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxpRR8FkTAeyt3fmDN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-26T14:09:22Z", "author": "Reign Mason", "text": "Is Python IDLE not good to use for SQLite3.
