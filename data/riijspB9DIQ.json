You can see in the demonstration that there's another \"helper\" line that goes straight down from the ceiling to the button, to make sure the cube will fall straight onto it. Providing both surfaces gives the player a bit more freedom to solve in their own way even though they both ultimately result in the same thing, the cube landing on the button.
