In the developer you will see the \"Quit Button Pushed\" text appear in your console tab, while in game it will quit properly.\n\nAlso, if you actually build the game it won't work. Firstly, the screen is off because the weird resolution the camera has, so in the title screen you won't see the Jungle Runner animation, and ingame you won't see the score. The only entity it registers are the trees. If your character collides with the bees, ninjas, shurikens, or squirrels, it just ignores them, sometimes pushing them along, if they also have a rigidbody.\n\nIdk if it's just my Unity, but it just seems that this game only works in the editor, not outside of it.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw9NhAX729WsxiDd_p4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-01-01T20:46:16Z", "author": "Echo Game Plus", "text": "hello bro, can you show how to make game like subway surf no matter how many takes just i want to make similar like that!
