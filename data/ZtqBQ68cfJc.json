These are called control characters (hence the CTRL key), as they don't represent graphical characters to be printed, but commands to control the device outputting the text. You can see them if you look at an ASCII table. For example ^G sends code 7, telling the receiver to ring a bell (a physical one originally). ^H (or the backspace key) moves the writing head back one character, which would let you fill in a space or print a character on top of another character, like O [Backspace] ^ would print \u00d4.\n  \n ^C sends the \"end of text\" character. ^J sends the \"line feed\" character, which on typewriters would feed the next line to the writing head, without moving the carriage back to the beginning of the new line. To start writing the new line you'd then also need the \"carriage return\" control character ^M. This is why new lines are LFCR (line feed carriage return) on Windows. On Unix-like systems, only the line feed character is used.\nYou may be familiar with the C escape sequences for these control codes: \\n (line feed) \\r (carriage return) \\0 (null) \\t (horizontal tab)   \nOne thing I love is that the Delete code is 1111111 in binary. This is because it was designed for punched cards/tape, where it would overwrite any other character by punching a hole in every position, in contrast to \\0 (null) - 0000000, which was supposed to be ignored and wouldn't do anything.", "likes": 46}, "replies": [{"author": "Pedro Turik Firmino", "text": "god tier comment", "likes": 1}, {"author": "I am a Lobster", "text": "Underrated comment.

And the only people who can override that law is the Supreme Court. They and their families has to live among us. If every state passes the same law then it is a Unity law.\nThe first Unity law that should be passed is attendance requirements for Congress. A couple of thousand students go to Washington every year to see our  government in action. Congress is in session and nobody's there. Senators and representatives should be required to meet a 90% attendance rate. These people are not important enough to be impeached. They should get R&R. Recalled and Replaced. \nEvery States has the right replace certain restrictions on their senators and representatives just as corporations have the right you have a moral clause.\nThe second Unity law that should be passed is Lobby restrictions.\nIf someone wants to Lobby Congress it should only be allowed to be done on the floor Congress. You want the lobby representative you do it on the floor of the house. If you want the lobbyists senator you do it on the floor of the Senate. This makes it easier you get rid of crooked politicians.
