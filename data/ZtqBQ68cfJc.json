Dr. Pooch spent an hour opining about all of the nice commands this OS called Unix offered, the most useful being a command called 'grep'. Little did I know that as my career developed grep would be my Swiss army knife for slicing and dicing text files.  I would add learning a bit about pipes because these commands are way more useful when you combine them together using pipes instead of going through intermediate files. Because of these commands and simple shell facilities like pipes I never needed to learn Perl, which is a honking huge language.

What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \"Linux\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\n\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

These are called control characters (hence the CTRL key), as they don't represent graphical characters to be printed, but commands to control the device outputting the text. You can see them if you look at an ASCII table. For example ^G sends code 7, telling the receiver to ring a bell (a physical one originally). ^H (or the backspace key) moves the writing head back one character, which would let you fill in a space or print a character on top of another character, like O [Backspace] ^ would print \u00d4.\n  \n ^C sends the \"end of text\" character. ^J sends the \"line feed\" character, which on typewriters would feed the next line to the writing head, without moving the carriage back to the beginning of the new line. To start writing the new line you'd then also need the \"carriage return\" control character ^M. This is why new lines are LFCR (line feed carriage return) on Windows. On Unix-like systems, only the line feed character is used.\nYou may be familiar with the C escape sequences for these control codes: \\n (line feed) \\r (carriage return) \\0 (null) \\t (horizontal tab)   \nOne thing I love is that the Delete code is 1111111 in binary. This is because it was designed for punched cards/tape, where it would overwrite any other character by punching a hole in every position, in contrast to \\0 (null) - 0000000, which was supposed to be ignored and wouldn't do anything.", "likes": 67}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugy79vTiCNcAHMeFDp54AaABAg.9_fsWUX0pkV9hfQPmVNZnC", "publishedAt": "2022-10-27T03:18:06Z", "author": "Pedro Turik Firmino", "text": "god tier comment", "likes": 1}, {"id": "Ugy79vTiCNcAHMeFDp54AaABAg.9_fsWUX0pkV9h6isC1EKci", "publishedAt": "2022-10-13T06:35:29Z", "author": "I am a Lobster", "text": "Underrated comment.

Mass Confusion is the tool being used herd the masses. If you want a Medical second opinion you now have to leave the country. When you go into the doctors office and give  them your birthday and social security number two things happen. First of all your medical records pop up because now they're on a central database. So whether you went to a quack or not everything is there. The second thing that happens is how  much money you owe and your credit score popps up.. So your medical treatment is basced on your credit score.  You can thank Hillary and Obama and  that bunch for that.  Hillary & Michelle Obama parents paid their bills(of course saints in their eyes). So they feel that this gives them the right to use the medical system to kill people who don't or can't pay their bills. If a white man gave all the black people a free cell phones they would have been suspicious especially when all the pay phones started disappearing. (Try and find one) Check out what's going on in China.... that's where we're being herded like cattle . The Illuminati found their man.\nThey gave all the poor health insurance not to help them, but so the medical industry can  make money off of them. This was their answer to high medical costs... \n New World Order here we come. Now if we can just get rid of that pesky cash.\nThis is why I'm a registered independent. The right in the left are in bed together their just trying to decide who's going to be on top.\nTrump wasn't trying to drain the swamp. He was simply redecorating.\nIf you want to drain the swamp you have to do it from the bottom. Our forefathers when they wrote the Constitution. They wrote it in such a way that this country can be ruled from the bottom up. If every state passes the same law then it is the law of the land. And the only people who can override that law is the Supreme Court. They and their families has to live among us. If every state passes the same law then it is a Unity law.\nThe first Unity law that should be passed is attendance requirements for Congress. A couple of thousand students go to Washington every year to see our  government in action. Congress is in session and nobody's there. Senators and representatives should be required to meet a 90% attendance rate. These people are not important enough to be impeached. They should get R&R. Recalled and Replaced. \nEvery States has the right replace certain restrictions on their senators and representatives just as corporations have the right you have a moral clause.\nThe second Unity law that should be passed is Lobby restrictions.\nIf someone wants to Lobby Congress it should only be allowed to be done on the floor Congress. You want the lobby representative you do it on the floor of the house. If you want the lobbyists senator you do it on the floor of the Senate. This makes it easier you get rid of crooked politicians. With multi media this campaign can easily go Nationwide.   ..\nThe man who picks up this banner and gets these laws passed. Will be the next president of the United States....", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzDVhxaiaSl3MyRVvV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-14T14:52:11Z", "author": "Vishnu Prasad", "text": "Aah the classic HIDING MY DOWNLOAD FROM YOU folder in the df command 02:43:38", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzn5sb_eJzZf7lRXqN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-14T09:12:25Z", "author": "Jaganmohan Kataru", "text": "Thanks!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxSyLpv3p1kE6v4nf14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-14T05:22:41Z", "author": "Nitin Chandar", "text": "10:56 what is linux", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyDVRfLtsm2QloS10F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-14T05:15:03Z", "author": "Juan Hauara", "text": "This gold dust.
