At this point I'm just copying what you're writing because I don't know or understand anything with AJAX or JQUERY. I have a very rudimentary understanding of JS which I suppose applies to any coding language. \n\nIf we could get a course for ASP and a separate course to actually teach us what's going on with JQUERY I'd be delighted. \nFor some of you this is probably perfect and hits the mark, but for me, I need my knowledge a bit more spoon fed.

I entered the exact information the SQL management application provided, as shown in this video, but I don't know what I don't know, so I'm missing a key part of this, and I'll return and update my comment later. \n\nFor now, in order to run migrations you'll need to go to the Terminal in Rider, and type \ndotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef\n\nThen you will have the ability to run migrations e.g.\ndotnet ef migrations add AddBookToDB\n\nThe SQL Database Server may not be presenting properly, OR the way this connection string presents may not work while trying to set this up locally.

The clarity of his voice and accent are poor to the point that often one cannot understand what this guy is saying.  Sound of the letter S is NOT same as SH, but this person is unable to pronounce those sounds correctly, making it very difficult to understand what he is saying  (many flaws in his speech - in English - cancel any benefit of the video for me). The word SHOULD is pronounced very differently than the word SIT, but this author fails to distinguish between the 2 sounds.  Good language skills and clarity of voice, accuracy of pronunciation in any language; especially in a training session, are extremely important.\n\nI have questions about the technical skills here as well, as he skips or is unable to explain some of the most important or basic steps he is taking in the video.  He claims that DI is about not having to create/destroy objects.  To me, it makes no sense.  It is much easier to create an object, than to follow the DI methods he speaks about in the video.\n\nHe is unable to to justify why Async/Await are needed OR are better and beneficial.  He also fails to state if one can use the simpler and easier to understand the method of just calling function WITHOUT use of Async/Await.  Now he may claim that it is either out of the context of the course or is irrelevant, but the fact is that many things are simply not explained.\n\nIf one was just to follow the steps he mentions, like a monkey, then, there is no benefit of this video, as I/one do/does not understand WHY things are done in more complex ways or in certain ways, when easier/quicker/shorter methods exist or have existed in previous versions of .NET.  As an example the author fails to explain/state, if dbconext can simply be created in a method, WITHOUT going thru the rituals of DI. and related additional steps/complexity.\n\nBecause he does not explain, WHY things are done in the way he proposes, I rate this video as - Poor.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Mike", "text": "@Jayo Caine Meaningless, bitter feedback does not help the author of the video or anyone else.
