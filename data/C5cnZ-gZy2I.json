I entered the exact information the SQL management application provided, as shown in this video, but I don't know what I don't know, so I'm missing a key part of this, and I'll return and update my comment later. \n\nFor now, in order to run migrations you'll need to go to the Terminal in Rider, and type \ndotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef\n\nThen you will have the ability to run migrations e.g.\ndotnet ef migrations add AddBookToDB\n\nThe SQL Database Server may not be presenting properly, OR the way this connection string presents may not work while trying to set this up locally. For the sake of getting through the tutorial and coming back later to learn how to connect remotely...\n\nIn Visual Studio go to View/ Server Explorer\nAssuming you haven't created a DB for this project, you can do that now. \nRight Click on Data Connections to create a new DB, or create a connection to an existing DB (for the sake of grabbing something from the connection string, this is helpful). \nAfter creating the new connection, click on the .dbo object under Data Connections. The Properties panel will display some info, including a \"Connection String\". \nTake note of the first part after \"Data Source =\" \nGrab the name of your server, e.g. YOURCOMPUTERNAME\n\nIn the connection string in \"appsettings.json\" I removed the \\\\MSSQL... bit.

The clarity of his voice and accent are poor to the point that often one cannot understand what this guy is saying.  Sound of the letter S is NOT same as SH, but this person is unable to pronounce those sounds correctly, making it very difficult to understand what he is saying  (many flaws in his speech - in English - cancel any benefit of the video for me). The word SHOULD is pronounced very differently than the word SIT, but this author fails to distinguish between the 2 sounds.  Good language skills and clarity of voice, accuracy of pronunciation in any language; especially in a training session, are extremely important.\n\nI have questions about the technical skills here as well, as he skips or is unable to explain some of the most important or basic steps he is taking in the video.  He claims that DI is about not having to create/destroy objects.  To me, it makes no sense.  It is much easier to create an object, than to follow the DI methods he speaks about in the video.\n\nHe is unable to to justify why Async/Await are needed OR are better and beneficial.  He also fails to state if one can use the simpler and easier to understand the method of just calling function WITHOUT use of Async/Await.  Now he may claim that it is either out of the context of the course or is irrelevant, but the fact is that many things are simply not explained.\n\nIf one was just to follow the steps he mentions, like a monkey, then, there is no benefit of this video, as I/one do/does not understand WHY things are done in more complex ways or in certain ways, when easier/quicker/shorter methods exist or have existed in previous versions of .NET.  As an example the author fails to explain/state, if dbconext can simply be created in a method, WITHOUT going thru the rituals of DI. and related additional steps/complexity.\n\nBecause he does not explain, WHY things are done in the way he proposes, I rate this video as - Poor.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugy8Hr0sy8SW0C_IXkB4AaABAg.9KWG7kmrWjE9VKoPfymu2s", "publishedAt": "2021-11-29T15:05:08Z", "author": "Mike", "text": "@Jayo Caine Meaningless, bitter feedback does not help the author of the video or anyone else.

Your comment exhibits your emotions, but does not focus on what I said.  Yes, the video is free to view, and I am grateful/thankful for that (although not quite free, because we are forced to watch ads, which are then monetized by the publisher; and time is money).  I posted my comment as feedback, so that the author knows where he could improve.  Just because something is free does NOT imply that one should not look to improve something.  The author may not know what to improve, unless the consumers of the content (in the context of videos) give tangible, direct feedback.  I feel, I am helping the author discover his shortcomings, which if he addresses, could/would improve the value/usefulness of his videos.  Posting comments costs me  (lost) time.  As such, I am helping and contributing.  I do not think in terms of emotions, as then, it would just be waste of everyone's time, with no meaningful data, results, actions.  Finally, the author is not necessarily providing us with free service.  Authors can and often do generate revenue from ads.  The author may also be publicising himself as a coder/programmer.  Us, the viewers/consumers of his content, are helping him achieve his objectives (fame, so to speak).  No one is doing anyone any favors; in the end it is all business; and that is fine.
