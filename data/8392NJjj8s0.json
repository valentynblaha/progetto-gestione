We start out with a very simple implementation of just dropping a piece randomly and then progress to choosing a column based on score and then finally implementing the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Initial code: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python\n\n\ud83c\udfa5Developing the initial connect four game: https://youtu.be/XpYz-q1lxu8\n\ud83c\udfa5How a board game AI works: https://youtu.be/y7AKtWGOPAE\n\ud83c\udfa5Alpha-beta pruning: https://youtu.be/l-hh51ncgDI\n\nVideo from Keith Galli.
