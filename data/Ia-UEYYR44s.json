I studied 1-2 hours every day for 4/5 weeks then took a week off work to bulk prepare the week leading to the exam. I see comments asking if this course is still applicable, below is my two cents:\n\nShort Answer: Yes but not exclusively.  Use in conjunction with other resources.\nLong Answer: I would say this does cover some core foundational knowledge, but due to its age it is missing some focus on other/new services. I would use this as your foundational knowledge to get a high level (and some low level) on the main services, but you will certainly not pass if you use this exclusively. Personally I used this in conjunction with Pluralsight (like Linkdin Learning, did the 12-hour Architect Associate Path), many test papers, AWS Learning resources and their documentation. Obviously everyone doesn't get the same test, but here's some details around mine\n\nNo questions related to DynamoDB \nNo questions on DR (Pilot Light, Warm Standby, etc)\nNo questions on EC2 types like when to choose Compute Optimised, etc\n2 Questions on AWS Organizations and SCPs (Service Control Policies) - this is not on this course and would have gotten me but I have extensive on-job experience with these. \n            - Ensure you cover Organizations at the high level, such as OUs and SCPs. SCPs have some key differences VS normal IAM policies.\n\n2/3 Questions on EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) - nothing 'Kubernetes-specific' but more about the service and CloudWatch Integration (Container Insights) - again not on this course and I have personal experience which got me through that questions\n\nMore questions than I was expecting on Windows-specific storage options. Make sure you know when to use a given service for windows or not - including FSx\n\nFew questions on analysing policies, picking the right one based on scenario given. Permission Boundary came up too.\nFew questions on IAM in general \nPlenty of questions on Autoscaling\nLots of questions on EBS, EFS - when to choose one or the other. I would say I got 6-8 questions across all 'topics' on these and details in some of these questions where not covered via this and require more detail knowledge.\nOnly one question on EBS Storage types.\nPlenty of questions on S3 and a few on SnowBall. \nPlenty of Questions on Aurora, RDS - these for me where some of the most difficult. Would recommend diving deep on Aurora more than what this course does. \nMore questions than I was expecting around VPN, Direct Connect, Private Link, Endpoints & Hybrid cloud options - these where also difficult for me\nFew questions on Storage gateway which I found challenging \nFew questions on KMS in general and when to use in each service VS service-native encryption for given scenario\nFew questions on Redshift but mostly picking no because questions related on 'Cost effective' solution for given scenario - which Redshift often wasn't for scenario given.\nFew questions on Kenisis - these where likely the ones I got mostly wrong as its a harder service to have experience with.", "likes": 11}, "replies": [{"author": "Eva :) ", "text": "THAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNKKKKKKKK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "John Agapi", "text": "Thank you very much @SkyFlex. - This was the most detailed comment.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sona Sunny", "text": "Great", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bu\u011fra \u00c7ay\u0131r", "text": "is this video still applicable for studying due to changes in the syllabus of the exam?", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "A Train", "text": "Guacamole is a tough word to spell", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rajeev Mahajan", "text": "FreeCodeCamp thanks a ton for the video!

I took Whizz labs paid practice test - but the exam was more difficult then whizz labs tests even. Try to write down the things which are new in the Mock tests which are not covered by Andrew Brown.

I was able to barely pass the test with your video along with the skillcert pro recommendation other folks have done here for practice.  I constantly rewatched the videos and did some of the follow alongs such as s3.  I definitely ended up reading the AWS docs to follow up after doing the exams on skillcert pro.  I did about 8 exams from skillcert.  In the practice exams  I scored around 28% after only watching 3 hours.  Then  61% after going through the whole video (about a full week). Then 77% after a few days of reviewing material again and going over the questions I missed in previous exams.  Then 69%, 65%, 72%,  and finally 86%.   I worked with a study group as well for about 3 days about an hour and half each day just to verbally discuss the concepts and topics I felt unsure about since I seem to learn better in engaged conversations vs simply watching videos and reading up on my own. In total I spent around 2 and a half weeks to prepare.  I do have a technical background and discuss it at a more high level the past 5-6 years, so watching the video Andrew provided really excelled my review and learning of the concepts in more detail.  For instance, I heard of S3, auto scaling groups, but how it worked and specific nuances of those services I wasn't aware of and had to learn.   I took the exam at a site in Santa Clara California via PSI.  Lastly, just wanted to say the skillcert pro can improve on its quality (misspelled words, there was one question where part of the question sentence was accidentally included in the answer, guess someone tired of copying and pasting).  Also, they can try to rephrase some of the questions so one doesn't get use to memorizing answers for questions but rather read into the concepts.

Use of * (wildcard) in SSL/TLS certificates is NOT a 'Best Practice' and can be a security vulnerability finding.  Best to plan out what your use-case(s) will be and use SAN (Subject Alternative Name) entries with your SSL/TLS certs, to cover the use-case(s).   (I have 15+ years of Enterprise PKI experience and can say that I've had numerous instances where certificate requesters used a Wildcard and at some point later (days or weeks) ended up with vulnerability findings and/or issues with various browsers accepting the wildcard.", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Patsadon Sangsuwan", "text": "Super thank", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Invatator", "text": "Where do we get the documents described at min @7:38?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Joseph Makram", "text": "Really Awesome", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "bluz.ro", "text": "Great work!", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sameer Kumar", "text": "You people are doing god's work", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "iraj kanwal", "text": "This is what i was looking for \ud83d\ude2dThankyou \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2d", "likes": 9}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "pavan Kumar", "text": "thanks bro god bless u", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "{BK}", "text": "Do have have aws cloud practitioner  certification before to AWS solutions architect certification?
