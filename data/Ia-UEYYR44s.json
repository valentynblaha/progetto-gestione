I studied 1-2 hours every day for 4/5 weeks then took a week off work to bulk prepare the week leading to the exam. I see comments asking if this course is still applicable, below is my two cents:\n\nShort Answer: Yes but not exclusively.  Use in conjunction with other resources.\nLong Answer: I would say this does cover some core foundational knowledge, but due to its age it is missing some focus on other/new services. I would use this as your foundational knowledge to get a high level (and some low level) on the main services, but you will certainly not pass if you use this exclusively. Personally I used this in conjunction with Pluralsight (like Linkdin Learning, did the 12-hour Architect Associate Path), many test papers, AWS Learning resources and their documentation. Obviously everyone doesn't get the same test, but here's some details around mine\n\nNo questions related to DynamoDB \nNo questions on DR (Pilot Light, Warm Standby, etc)\nNo questions on EC2 types like when to choose Compute Optimised, etc\n2 Questions on AWS Organizations and SCPs (Service Control Policies) - this is not on this course and would have gotten me but I have extensive on-job experience with these. \n            - Ensure you cover Organizations at the high level, such as OUs and SCPs. SCPs have some key differences VS normal IAM policies.\n\n2/3 Questions on EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) - nothing 'Kubernetes-specific' but more about the service and CloudWatch Integration (Container Insights) - again not on this course and I have personal experience which got me through that questions\n\nMore questions than I was expecting on Windows-specific storage options. Make sure you know when to use a given service for windows or not - including FSx\n\nFew questions on analysing policies, picking the right one based on scenario given. Permission Boundary came up too.\nFew questions on IAM in general \nPlenty of questions on Autoscaling\nLots of questions on EBS, EFS - when to choose one or the other. I would say I got 6-8 questions across all 'topics' on these and details in some of these questions where not covered via this and require more detail knowledge.\nOnly one question on EBS Storage types.\nPlenty of questions on S3 and a few on SnowBall. \nPlenty of Questions on Aurora, RDS - these for me where some of the most difficult. Would recommend diving deep on Aurora more than what this course does. \nMore questions than I was expecting around VPN, Direct Connect, Private Link, Endpoints & Hybrid cloud options - these where also difficult for me\nFew questions on Storage gateway which I found challenging \nFew questions on KMS in general and when to use in each service VS service-native encryption for given scenario\nFew questions on Redshift but mostly picking no because questions related on 'Cost effective' solution for given scenario - which Redshift often wasn't for scenario given.\nFew questions on Kenisis - these where likely the ones I got mostly wrong as its a harder service to have experience with.", "likes": 11}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyOpLX2e5_UDORBITx4AaABAg.9ZWlygvtZBg9bWXVWXHPw0", "publishedAt": "2022-05-27T03:59:17Z", "author": "Eva Tenya", "text": "THAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNKKKKKKKK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyOpLX2e5_UDORBITx4AaABAg.9ZWlygvtZBg9_crMd5hBwg", "publishedAt": "2022-04-10T07:13:28Z", "author": "John Agapi", "text": "Thank you very much @SkyFlex. - This was the most detailed comment.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyqfdXsWd8yfHSVda94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-13T16:39:20Z", "author": "Sona Sunny", "text": "Great", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwkUNWHx7gSg1fl0pJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-08T20:00:58Z", "author": "Bu\u011fra \u00c7ay\u0131r", "text": "is this video still applicable for studying due to changes in the syllabus of the exam?", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw7sU32XY7Xj5YWLDp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-05T20:02:52Z", "author": "A Train", "text": "Guacamole is a tough word to spell", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxvEwHIk1Lhj_ucY054AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-01T09:02:27Z", "author": "Rajeev Mahajan", "text": "FreeCodeCamp thanks a ton for the video!

Some advice to people who are planning to take SAA: \nTry to consume all the question resources free ones and paid ones too.  I took Whizz labs paid practice test - but the exam was more difficult then whizz labs tests even. Try to write down the things which are new in the Mock tests which are not covered by Andrew Brown. I had zero previous AWS experience except the CCP  exam which I passed a week ago from Andrew Browns video. In addition, Andrew browns videos might not be enough resource, try to consume every free resource in YouTube. I was working with these videos 12-14 hours a day writing everything down (maybe that's why it took me so much hours per day), but you don't have to target it in one week.

I was able to barely pass the test with your video along with the skillcert pro recommendation other folks have done here for practice.  I constantly rewatched the videos and did some of the follow alongs such as s3.  I definitely ended up reading the AWS docs to follow up after doing the exams on skillcert pro.  I did about 8 exams from skillcert.  In the practice exams  I scored around 28% after only watching 3 hours.  Then  61% after going through the whole video (about a full week). Then 77% after a few days of reviewing material again and going over the questions I missed in previous exams.  Then 69%, 65%, 72%,  and finally 86%.   I worked with a study group as well for about 3 days about an hour and half each day just to verbally discuss the concepts and topics I felt unsure about since I seem to learn better in engaged conversations vs simply watching videos and reading up on my own. In total I spent around 2 and a half weeks to prepare.  I do have a technical background and discuss it at a more high level the past 5-6 years, so watching the video Andrew provided really excelled my review and learning of the concepts in more detail.  For instance, I heard of S3, auto scaling groups, but how it worked and specific nuances of those services I wasn't aware of and had to learn.   I took the exam at a site in Santa Clara California via PSI.  Lastly, just wanted to say the skillcert pro can improve on its quality (misspelled words, there was one question where part of the question sentence was accidentally included in the answer, guess someone tired of copying and pasting).  Also, they can try to rephrase some of the questions so one doesn't get use to memorizing answers for questions but rather read into the concepts. Hopefully that helps everyone, I just wanted to provide  my feedback since I learned a lot from you all that posted.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyzbi3itAoQSVbtouJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-07T09:30:46Z", "author": "Fernando Lovera", "text": "- on 1st hour you have the cheat sheet of s3.\n- on 1 h 09 min you have the cheat sheet of smowball & snowballmobile.\n- on 1 h 26 min you have the cheat sheet of VPC endpoints.\n- on 1 h 29 min you have the cheat sheet of VPC flow logs.\n- on 1 h 32 min you have the cheat sheet of Network Access Control List (NACLs).\n- on 1 h 38 min you have the cheat sheet of Security Groups.\n- on 1 h 46 min you have the cheat sheet of NAT gateways.\n- on 2 h 58 min you have the cheat sheet of Cognito cheat sheet.\n- on 3 h 21 min you have the cheat sheet of AWS Cli, SDK.\n- on 3 h 30 min you have the cheat sheet of DNS.\n- on 3 h 45 min you have the cheat sheet of Route 53.\n- on 3 h 56 min you have the cheat sheet of EC2 instances.\n- on 4 h 04 min you have the cheat sheet of EC2 pricing.\n- on 4 h 13 min you have the cheat sheet of AMI.\n- on 4 h 24 min you have the cheat sheet of Auto Scaling Groups.\n- on 4 h 35 min you have the cheat sheet of ELB.\n- on 5 h 49 min you have the cheat sheet of EFS.\n- on 6 h 02 min you have the cheat sheet of EBS.\n- on 6 h 21 min you have the cheat sheet of CloudFront.\n- on 7 h 00 min you have the cheat sheet of RDS.\n- on 7 h 07 min you have the cheat sheet of Aurora Serverless.\n- on 7 h 18 min you have the cheat sheet of Redshift.\n- on 7 h 24 min you have the cheat sheet of DynamoDB.\n- on 7 h 31 min you have the cheat sheet of CloudFormation.\n- on 7 h 31 min you have the cheat sheet of CloudFormation.\n- on 7 h 52 min you have the cheat sheet of CloudWatch.\n- on 8 h 06 min you have the cheat sheet of CloudTrail.\n- on 8 h 18 min you have the cheat sheet of Lambda.\n- on 8 h 28 min you have the cheat sheet of SQS.\n- on 8 h 37 min you have the cheat sheet of SNS.\n- on 9 h 02 min you have the cheat sheet of Elastic Beanstalk.\n- on 9 h 12 min you have the cheat sheet of API Gateway.\n- on 9 h 20 min you have the cheat sheet of Kinesis.\n- on 9 h 29 min you have the cheat sheet of Storage gateway.", "likes": 39}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugyzbi3itAoQSVbtouJ4AaABAg.9GxyMOiHAaq9IdQJhVA-Dg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-18T03:02:33Z", "author": "Mahan", "text": "THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz4xyioGyqUtwCrCGl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-07T07:25:52Z", "author": "Being AJ", "text": "v good content", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz9y8zdNNKk1AahX0Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-06T18:17:16Z", "author": "Jimmy T.", "text": "SAA C02 in the pocket ( score 861/1000 ) thanks instructor !\n\nAs a complement to this long tutorial, I suggest practicing the exam questions in :\n- examtopics ( its free ): https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/ \n- SkillCertPro (cost  20$):  https://skillcertpro.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-full-practice-sets/ \n\nGood luck ! :)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy6gzx72Lq8eKz3tqh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-06T11:42:05Z", "author": "Yassine EL GHAYANI", "text": "CloudFront can serve dynamic and static web content, plz if your are agree can fix that in the cheatsheet?\nthere is a policy with no cache active, can be used for dynamic content\nThx", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw4_D_dj9j0cCW3kW54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-06T05:44:08Z", "author": "PANDU U", "text": "Does this course is helpful only for server admins or even for network security roles as well..,Could someone comment", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx-xJX9DcAq2LQyOkx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-05T17:42:46Z", "author": "J\u00e9r\u00e9my PROF", "text": "Very good contents.

Someone told me this a few days before I sat for the exam. I was so happy they did. The questions are long and in-depth and if you don't understand the differences between services very well and know how to identify key words in the question and requirements you will have a very difficult time passing.
