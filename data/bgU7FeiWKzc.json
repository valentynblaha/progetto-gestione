The reason because you get the same values through different instances is because of closures.

It's just an object wrapped in an iffe that only returns the public methods and variables. Think of like a banking application or delicate configuration files, where you'd want extra assurance that an account number/configuration variable/method couldn't be accessible anywhere else except through a single object instance. Well, this is one which way how you could achieve such. There are a ton of use cases. The only 'real' important method (function) to take real note of is the public one near the bottom, the one called privateRandomNumber. THAT is the only way to access that innerVariable (private variable, say bank account info or a gateway, for example). The init function is just a way to create the new instance (create a new object). All instances share the same reference values (so say if you had a method that changed an array in object a, the array would be updated in object b as well, assuming they were created via the same Singleton). A very basic object literal and its properties are much easier to overwrite than you'd think, especially on a big project. In this example, he only showcases accessing privateRandomNumber to access said private variables. Say you wanted to access that privateMethod, well, you could create a public method called getPrivateMethod that's sole expression is to return the privateMethod. Don't overthink it. Javascript doesn't exactly have true OOP like something like Java, so this is one way to create a closure to access private variables and methods that are all accessed via a global variable (aka, the Singleton). The only real downside is that you're polluting the global namespace with that mySingleton variable. On bigger projects with tons of files, you have to be aware of such things. Personally, I don't use them, or haven't needed to, they're more of an anti-pattern imo, but hopefully this can bring understanding to someone.", "likes": 17}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Penny G", "text": "Crystal clear & straightforward example.
