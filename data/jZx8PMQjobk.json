John 3:17\r\n\r\nJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\r\n- John 14:6 KJV\r\n\r\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12\r\n\r\nFor if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 \r\n\r\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 \r\n\r\nAnd saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\r\n- Mark 1:15 KJV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\r\n- John 3:36 KJV\r\n\r\nWho hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 \r\n\r\nFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 \r\n\r\nThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9\r\n\r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
