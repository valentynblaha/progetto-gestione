Usually the definition of an identity element is an element E such that for all A in S:\n\nE(Union)A=A\nA(Union)E=A. \n\nThis is consistent with how the empty set works when using Union as an operator, but with the way you have it when we operate with the Universe we do not get back the A (what we started with) we get back the universe:\n\nU(Union)A=U\nA(Union)U=U\n\nSo the U element does not satisfy the definition of an identity element as I have defined it, because it is not the case that for all A in S:\n\nU(Union)A=A\nA(Union)U=A\n\nIf we look at U under the Intersection operation, then it functions like an identity for that operation:\n\nU(Intersection)A=A\nA(Intersection)U=A", "likes": 0}}]}
