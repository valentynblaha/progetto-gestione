The app uses the Volley library to create a weather app using API data. \n\nThis course includes advice on building a RequestQueue, designing a Singleton, and using callbacks for async network communications. You will also learn to use the Volley library methods JsonArrayRequest and JsonArrayObject to parse a JSON file.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course developed by Shad Sluiter.
