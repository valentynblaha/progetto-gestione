I am currently learning python and have been using numerous sources to learn. As my main aim was to use python for automation, my main source has been the udemy course Automate the boring stuff with python along with the text book for exercises.\n\nHowever, I have come across a few problems. I am learning to create programs. For example I have learnt how to make a web scraper. The problem is, I know how to make one but I dont fully understand it. Like i know to use the beautiful soup module and I know what functions to import as the course/books tell me. But i dont fully understand. Like if i was to create a program completely different. How do i know what modules to use and what functions are in that module that i could use? On the course it tells you what functions to use but the thing is, if i didnt watch the video, how would i know what function to use. It doesn't tell you where you can find the functions and use what you need. Although this is the only flaw in a really good book i have to say, I have learnt a lot from this course but this part i seem to struggle with and it seems to be the same with other courses i have tried.\n\nI want to be a programmer that will be given a problem and i know how to create a solution. Like i will know exactly what module to use, what functions are in that module that i will need etc. For now i am just learning to make an app for a problem the course provides me but i dont know how i would be able to alter it to tailor my own circumstances. I want to be able to understand everything that I am writing.\n\nI know that this will only come with experience, but i just need to get the ball rolling. I have seen loads of similar questions on the internet and the majority of them say to just build as many applications as you can. However, actually doing this is a little more daunting if you dont understand it properly.\n\nSo my main question is for you is when you first started programming regardless of what language it was, is how did you break through the barrier that is holding me back at the moment. Like what did you do after learning the syntax , what did you build own your own, how did you get there, how did you know what modules/functions to use and how do you understand fully what you are actually doing rather than just learning a method to a specific problem and apply those to different problems?\n\nThanks", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwALqvhZpiTbjSmk5t4AaABAg.9JMICKbnhNS9JV2F2A-90R", "publishedAt": "2021-02-08T08:10:25Z", "author": "Reem Bagadi", "text": "Z library Africa has every book that comes to mind,", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwCNho3RoIu5lHVP8Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-04T19:13:36Z", "author": "Maaz Qureshi", "text": "Best news of the year..keep up the Good Work Best of luck for Fund Raising <3", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwE0xEqPzFbnpYliCF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-04T18:25:55Z", "author": "Tejas", "text": "You guys are the best.
