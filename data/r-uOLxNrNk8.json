Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.\n\nIn this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.\nAdditionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Course created by Santiago Basulto from RMOTR\n\ud83d\udd17 Check out all Data Science courses from RMOTR: https://rmotr.com\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Note: Instead of loading the notebooks on notebooks.ai, you should use Google Colab instead.

Am\u00e9m.\n\n Hist\u00f3ria da Sagrada Face de Jesus\n\nEsta santa devo\u00e7\u00e3o teve origem com a impress\u00e3o milagrosa do Rosto de Cristo no len\u00e7o de Ver\u00f4nica, uma tradi\u00e7\u00e3o muito respeitada na Igreja. O Papa Bento XVI fez quest\u00e3o de venerar o V\u00e9u de Ver\u00f4nica na cidade de Manoppello na It\u00e1lia, em setembro de 2006. Durante sua visita ao santu\u00e1rio, Bento XVI foi o primeiro Papa a poder novamente venerar a rel\u00edquia, meio mil\u00eanio ap\u00f3s seu desaparecimento da Bas\u00edlica de S\u00e3o Pedro.\n\nEsta devo\u00e7\u00e3o cresceu muito tamb\u00e9m por causa da import\u00e2ncia que a Divina Face teve na vida de Santa Teresinha do Menino Jesus e da Sagrada Face. Outro fato que fortaleceu a devo\u00e7\u00e3o foram os surpreendentes estudos da figura de JESUS no santo Sud\u00e1rio de Turim; al\u00e9m das revela\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e0 Irm\u00e3 M. Pierina de Micheli (\u20201945), a mensageira da Sagrada Face dos \u00faltimos tempos.\n\nEm maio de 1938, a Virgem Sant\u00edssima mostrou (em vis\u00e3o m\u00edstica) \u00e0 Irm\u00e3 Pierina, um escapul\u00e1rio formado de dois paninhos. Num ela viu a Face de JESUS com as palavras ao redor: \u201cIlumina, Domine, vultum tuum super nos\u201d (\u201cSenhor, fazei resplandecer a Vossa Face sobre n\u00f3s\u201d). No outro estavam escritas em volta de uma h\u00f3stia as palavras: \u201cMane nobiscum, domine\u201d (Senhor ficai conosco). Lentamente Nossa Senhora se aproximou e disse:\n\n\u201cEscuta bem e transmite ao teu confessor que este escapul\u00e1rio \u00e9 uma arma de defesa, escudo de fortaleza e penhor de miseric\u00f3rdia que JESUS quer dar ao mundo nestes tempos de sensualidade e de \u00f3dio contra DEUS e a Igreja. S\u00e3o poucos os verdadeiros ap\u00f3stolos. \u00c9 necess\u00e1rio um rem\u00e9dio divino e este rem\u00e9dio \u00e9 a FACE de meu Filho.\n\nTodos aqueles que usarem o escapul\u00e1rio, e sendo lhes poss\u00edvel, cada ter\u00e7a feira visitar o Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento fazendo \u201cUma Hora Santa\u201d, para reparar os ultrajes que recebeu e continua recebendo meu Filho, cada dia, no Sacramento Eucar\u00edstico, ser\u00e3o fortificados na F\u00e9, estar\u00e3o prontos para defend\u00ea-la e h\u00e3o de suportar todas as dificuldades internas e externas. Al\u00e9m disso morrer\u00e3o serenamente sob o olhar de meu Filho\u201d.\n\nSemanas mais tarde JESUS apareceu tamb\u00e9m e disse:\n\n\u201cQuero que Minha FACE seja honrada com uma festa pr\u00f3pria na Ter\u00e7a-feira da Quinquag\u00e9sima (ter\u00e7a-feira de carnaval) e que esta festa seja preparada por uma novena durante a qual todos os fi\u00e9is fa\u00e7am Comigo repara\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d.\n\nEm vez de fazer escapul\u00e1rios a Irm\u00e3 Pierina mandou cunhar medalhas. Preocupada por isso recorreu \u00e0 Nossa Senhora que novamente lhe apareceu dizendo:\n\n\u201cMinha filha, n\u00e3o se preocupe, pois, o escapul\u00e1rio \u00e9 substitu\u00eddo pela medalha com todas as promessas e favores. S\u00f3 resta difundi-la mais ainda. Ora, interessa-me muito a festa da Sagrada FACE de meu Filho. Diga ao Papa que esta festa muito me interessa\u201d.\n\nIrm\u00e3 M. Pierina falou tr\u00eas vezes ao Papa e o Sumo Pont\u00edfice, ciente do pedido do C\u00e9u, n\u00e3o se fez esperar. No dia 15 de mar\u00e7o de 1957, havendo j\u00e1 aprovado a propaga\u00e7\u00e3o da medalha, facultou a celebra\u00e7\u00e3o da festa, isto \u00e9, aos Beneditinos Silvestrinos de Roma. Em 10 de janeiro de 1959 o Papa Jo\u00e3o XXIII concedeu a mesma licen\u00e7a, a todos os Bispos do Brasil.\n\nPara merecer as gra\u00e7as prometidas \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio:\n\nUsar a medalha, contemplar com amor, muitas vezes a Sagrada FACE, zelar pela devo\u00e7\u00e3o, fazendo a Hora Santa, nas Ter\u00e7as-feiras, promover anualmente a novena em prepara\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 festa na ter\u00e7a-feira de carnaval, e seguindo o exemplo dos grandes devotos da Sagrada FACE, ler e meditar diariamente o Novo Testamento. Todos os dias rezar:\n\n5 Pai Nossos; 5 Ave Marias; 5 Gl\u00f3rias; em honra das cinco chagas de Nosso Senhor JESUS CRISTO, rezando tamb\u00e9m a ora\u00e7\u00e3o composta por Pio IX, e a aspira\u00e7\u00e3o que a segue:\n\n\u201c\u00d3 meu JESUS, lan\u00e7ai sobre n\u00f3s um olhar de miseric\u00f3rdia! Volvei Vossa Face para cada um de n\u00f3s, como fizestes \u00e0 Ver\u00f4nica, n\u00e3o para que A vejamos com os olhos corporais, pois n\u00e3o o merecemos. Mas volvei-A para os nossos cora\u00e7\u00f5es, a fim de que, amparados sempre em V\u00f3s, possamos haurir nesta fonte inesgot\u00e1vel, as for\u00e7as necess\u00e1rias para nos entregarmos ao combate que temos que sustentar.
