It took me 170 lines to write the same functionality. (NB: My vanilla js was slightly more efficient code because it was the second time I wrote the same app, so I had refactored some stuff). So I'd estimate the jQuery probably had about half the lines of code overall. The main reason why the jQuery was slightly leaner (in terms of lines of code) was because of the ability to chain statements together, rather than reselecting elements.\n\n\nI think jQuery has a slight advantage in terms of readability... but it's not a big deal.\n\n\nIn my case, jQuery is probably still the best option, because I'm likely going to want to use jQuery UI as the app develops. Otherwise I'd have to rewrite some of the same functionality jQuery UI provides.\n\n\nAs with everything, I guess it all depends on what you need to do. If all you are doing is basic web enhancement stuff, vanilla js is perfectly fine. But the more you go beyond that, the more you appreciate out of the box solutions...\n\n\nI think it's great though that js is evolving into a leaner and more powerful scripting language. And when you combine it with CSS3, you've really got a lot more power and flexibility than we had previously.", "likes": 11}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyf2WwtZdStqIm_Kop4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-20T10:47:24Z", "author": "Fahmi Abdillah", "text": "But vanilla is faster than even you use jquery", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzgNzT0yaMrWPVxLPd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-10-28T11:34:28Z", "author": "Busherino LoL", "text": "Isn't it common do use a $ sign infront of vannilla queryselector variables aswell ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz7F_U7i08T76pbCCx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-04-26T11:55:10Z", "author": "David K", "text": "var gdI = document.getElementById.bind(document);\nvar an_el = gdl('an_id');", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz7JjTfMa5bvTl-KFx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-02-14T15:28:43Z", "author": "arjang ap", "text": "Just JQuery\u2764", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwyYij3jR_r40-Payl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-06-18T20:28:14Z", "author": "Arcane Lore", "text": "What percentage Javascript cover Jquery in?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwyYij3jR_r40-Payl4AaABAg.8hdzmgdZulE8hfwGgFG-1O", "publishedAt": "2018-06-19T14:36:00Z", "author": "freeCodeCamp.org", "text": "A lot of things from jQuery has been put into JavaScript.
