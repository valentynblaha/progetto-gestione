One question about the globalaveragepooling layer. After embedding we are actually taking the average of the embedding features over all the word vectors and not the average of every individual vector? Say we have 2 words in a sentence that we want to predict the sentiment of: \"Very nice\" -> [1,1,1,1], [2,2,2,2] -> 2 words, 2 word vectors with 4 embedding features (contexts). The correct way is to take the average over these vectors so the lower dimensional output is [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5], that we then pass to the dense layer. And the incorrect way is to output a 2 dimensional vector averaging the 2 vectors individually -> output: [1, 2]? Just averaging every word vector individually and passing every single one in a new vector doesn't make sense to me and would just throw away the context.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy9N5_ebnNfE82TMpd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-12-02T03:23:02Z", "author": "Pankaj Chand", "text": "Does this course teach Keras in Tensorflow, or pure Tensorflow only?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyvC0ipmve_wqggsEV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-19T20:59:46Z", "author": "Alex", "text": "I feel like this was a Keras tutorial", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxJF0kXAeMm0ouNoIF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-15T10:40:09Z", "author": "Amir Taghavy", "text": "Thanks for making this insightful video.
