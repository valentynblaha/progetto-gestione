After embedding we are actually taking the average of the embedding features over all the word vectors and not the average of every individual vector? Say we have 2 words in a sentence that we want to predict the sentiment of: \"Very nice\" -> [1,1,1,1], [2,2,2,2] -> 2 words, 2 word vectors with 4 embedding features (contexts). The correct way is to take the average over these vectors so the lower dimensional output is [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5], that we then pass to the dense layer. And the incorrect way is to output a 2 dimensional vector averaging the 2 vectors individually -> output: [1, 2]? Just averaging every word vector individually and passing every single one in a new vector doesn't make sense to me and would just throw away the context.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pankaj Chand", "text": "Does this course teach Keras in Tensorflow, or pure Tensorflow only?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Alex", "text": "I feel like this was a Keras tutorial", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Amir Taghavy", "text": "Thanks for making this insightful video.
