I represent the sudoku grid as a two dimensional array as you can see here.... um ok, You'll see that I forgot to write int...... did you? where? well as an absolute beginner I stopped the video at this point because telling me you missed something that is obvious and that you will add back in later isn't obvious until you know it.
