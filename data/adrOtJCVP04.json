Learn Full-stack JavaScript, build a portfolio, and get a coding job by joining our open source community at http://freecodecamp.com\n\nFollow Quincy on Quora: http://www.quora.com/Quincy-Larson\n\nFollow us on Twitch: twitch.tv/freecodecamp\n\nFollow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=freecodecamp\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp\n\nStar us on GitHub: https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp\n\nObjective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://stark-lowlands-3680.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.\n\nNote that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-basejumps.\n\nAs you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running git commit -am \"your commit message\". Note that you should replace \"your commit message\" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.\n\nYou can push these new commits to GitHub by running git push origin master, and to Heroku by running grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku.\n\nHere are the specific User Stories you should implement for this Basejump:\n\nUser Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can link to images.\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.\n\nUser Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.\n\nBonus User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)\n\nHint: Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.\n\nIf you need further guidance on using Yeoman Angular-Fullstack Generator, check out: https://github.com/clnhll/guidetobasejumps.", "duration": "PT3M57S", "likes": 0, "views": "13508"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UghL6kw4bFrow3gCoAEC", "publishedAt": "2017-06-18T20:03:34Z", "author": "Blazertron", "text": "How would you stop people from posting inappropriate content?
