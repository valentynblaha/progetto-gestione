Without these, a Kanban Board is just another fancy TODO list, whereas using hard WIP limits forces you to change your style of working in a very profound way (because you have to finish things before you\u2019re allowed to start new ones).", "likes": 8}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Puta Une", "text": "cookieee monster !", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "M CC", "text": "LOVE this!
