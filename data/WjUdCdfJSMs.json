When x=y, it becomes sqrt(A). So, if A is not a prime number, it would have atleast 1 factor between 2 and sqrt(A). All this is ok, in the context of determining whether A is a prime number of not.\nBut, u have used the sqrt(A) approach while computing the largest prime factor of A as well. This can sometimes fail. For example, consider A=123456. sqrt(A) is 351. Largest prime factor is 643.\nYour algo failed becoz u r checking numbers between 2 and 351 (sqrt(A)) only. So, when A/x=y, and x<y, u are checking only from 2 to sqrt(A), and not checking from sqrt(A) till A.\nSo, to fix the bug in ur algo, for every factor \"x\" of A identified between 2 and sqrt(A), we should first check if y (=A/x) is a prime factor. When we do this, for A=123456, x=192, y=643, 643 becomes the largest prime factor even though sqrt(A) is 351.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyRLmvnwIS-PSEZdGJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-06-10T16:07:16Z", "author": "JAY NIRAJ RAJ", "text": "i am from indian sir can you help me in programming language.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxjK28Yh6qmN2bmndp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-06-10T16:05:38Z", "author": "JAY NIRAJ RAJ", "text": "thanks sir", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwtCZoWLdDU5csfbKl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-28T12:59:26Z", "author": "Mohit Daga", "text": "Challenge 3rd is not working for digit 8", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwXuzkPRTP8uPLb8st4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-25T04:03:27Z", "author": "gustavo parra", "text": "what is that language?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwXuzkPRTP8uPLb8st4AaABAg.993h5Xf1yzH99Cu4-NBK_f", "publishedAt": "2020-05-28T17:50:00Z", "author": "Iliass Elyaa", "text": "@Mohit Daga not python", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwXuzkPRTP8uPLb8st4AaABAg.993h5Xf1yzH99CNtBjCmwi", "publishedAt": "2020-05-28T13:00:02Z", "author": "Mohit Daga", "text": "I think python", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwXuzkPRTP8uPLb8st4AaABAg.993h5Xf1yzH999zTwj6upo", "publishedAt": "2020-05-27T14:39:31Z", "author": "Vijaykumar Bhavanur", "text": "JavaScript", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzXBMdmDuL9uydJ-Gt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-22T21:48:51Z", "author": "Mario Adelin", "text": "Rom\u00e2nia, aia zic\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzVDECnoYhik2Zf3ep4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-12T02:58:27Z", "author": "Rachid", "text": "Thanks .. that was very helpful, after having watched that I revised some of the Javascript basics that I learned a while ago, and now I'm trying to do these challenging code using Python.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzVDECnoYhik2Zf3ep4AaABAg.98Y6K2V7VdX9NEXJrgOcHp", "publishedAt": "2021-05-12T08:20:27Z", "author": "Brahvim", "text": ":D!\nI am actually thankful that this as not in py LOL.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgymAN3vjNSYe6sDpEJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-11T21:51:10Z", "author": "JinxScript", "text": "JS \ud83d\udc80", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgymAN3vjNSYe6sDpEJ4AaABAg.98XZ9Sqqg6C9NEXGHoNiLj", "publishedAt": "2021-05-12T08:19:58Z", "author": "Brahvim", "text": "_I am actually thankful this was not in Python_", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxVdcE2UIuei8Ms-0Z4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-11T17:14:52Z", "author": "Himanshu Sharma 17", "text": "Make video on more questions", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwuNbSklobpS5XwQl54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-05-10T21:58:47Z", "author": "seba81uy", "text": "Hi I'm new to code and struggled cause the only  language I (barely) know is python but the solution for this problem I tried\nx=target number\ni=2\n\nWhile x != 1:\n     If x % i == 0:\n     x=x/i\n    Else:\n    i += i\nPrint(i)\n\nNice video hope to be in the next stream", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwuNbSklobpS5XwQl54AaABAg.98V-ENEUby69By-juazk1M", "publishedAt": "2020-08-05T03:14:37Z", "author": "Bum Bum", "text": "Schnorzel1337 No i just asked what problem he did, I wasn\u2019t talking about his code.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwuNbSklobpS5XwQl54AaABAg.98V-ENEUby69BxlyCY4C9h", "publishedAt": "2020-08-05T01:05:30Z", "author": "Schnorzel1337", "text": "\u200b@Bum Bum This solves nothing.
