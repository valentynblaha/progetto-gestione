There's a large-ish set of problems that you can catch quickly without having to reload your app. Often they appear during refactoring, since you need to update each reference to whatever you changed. Finding them manually takes longer, and there's no way to be sure you haven't missed any.\n\nUnit testing helps there, but it's a classic \"Turing tarpit\" -- lacking some language feature, the poor dev is doomed to endlessly reimplement it.\n\n(The catch, IMO, is that static types add friction in the early stages of getting an idea down, with the amount depending on how \"meta\" the idea is.)", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxeSp5ROuQlaHXHY0x4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-09-08T05:09:28Z", "author": "Jorge Ricaldi", "text": "omg, I just saw a video about Elixir and its syntax was a little rare for me,  but this one is really a pain in the brain.", "likes": 5}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxeSp5ROuQlaHXHY0x4AaABAg.8kvUpBHNgp28yHbWdZbs78", "publishedAt": "2019-08-06T07:27:22Z", "author": "XPopCornX", "text": "@Ondrej Pinka Any IDE I have ever used for Java has done that.
