Second, nice to know you're ignoring the height of the person, it seems right given the input (string length) has only _one_ significant digit (in fact it's just an order of magnitude). But that makes your cm-precise height of a kite completely bogus. Not just the person, the kite itself is larger than 1cm, so it really doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\n1:59:35 tan(theta) is not a function, tan is a function. You say it correctly when speaking about sin and cos at 1:58:20 and 1:58:29.\r\n\r\n2:03:00 If you partially extract sqrt from 45/49 in the denominator, you should also do so in the numerator. It's 3sqrt5/7, of course.\r\n\r\n2:04:27 \"Just sticking a negative sign in front\" really should be better justified. What you just showed with the picture is sin(t)=2/7 implies cos(t)=3sqrt5/7. How does it follow that if sin(t)=-2/7 and cos(t)<0, then cos(t)=-3sqrt5/7? Either back to the Pythagorean property for arbitrary angles, or at least draw two triangles in the coordinate system, in QI and QIII, and argue they are congruent.\r\n\r\n2:10:59 Of course not. You should also say that 2pi is the _smallest_ such number, in order for it to be the period.\r\n\r\n2:16:13 If you look at my comments on Algebra video, you'll see exactly why is that. You're transforming coordinate systems, not graphs.\r\n\r\n2:41:44 But also a number. There is a very weird idea in precalculus, that angle measures are something different than ordinary real numbers. Of course, as soon as you start thinking in terms of calculus, and realize that sin'=cos, the LHS would have to have units number/angle, and the RHS just number, you see there is no other way than just accept that arguments of trigonometric functions are the most mundane real numbers.\r\n\r\n2:46:17 It always is (when dealing with a noninjective function). When defining sqrt, we could have picked the negative branch. :-)\r\n\r\n2:57:00 Of course not. Same as sqrt(x^2) is not x for all x, arccos(cos t) is not t except when t is between 0 and pi. Yes, you correct yourself later, but \"this gives me\" should already be suspicious.\r\n\r\n3:12:15 It's not the same thing. It is the same thing unless cos x is zero. If you really want to define identities as equalities that hold for _all_ values of a variable, then this is not an identity.\r\n\r\n3:27:50 Only if A+B is less than pi/2. Other cases require different proofs, it seems.\r\n\r\n3:38:17 Or simply x=pi/2+kpi.\r\n\r\n3:43:19 That's obviously impossible, since theta is obtuse. You probably meant pi-theta.\r\n\r\n3:44:40 I thought it was customary to rationalize the denominators there.\r\n\r\n3:49:26 _Because_ theta is inside the domain for restricted cosine. That's why your idea of \"another planet\" where the aliens use a different branch to invert cosine doesn't really hold water: since trig functions are usually used and primarily motivated to solve the triangles, we better make sure that the restricted versions (and their inverses) are useful for that particular case. (Also in 3:58:41 for example.)\r\n\r\n3:53:25 Why? Yes, in the _same_ triangle larger angle is opposite to larger side, but those are different triangles. It can probably be proved (without using law of cosines:), but it is in no way obvious.\r\n\r\n4:00:54 You should teach students to use calculator's memory for intermediate results! Or at least use \"double the decimals\" rule: calculate everything with 4 decimals, report results with 2 decimals. Otherwise, there will almost always be embarassing accumulation of errors.\r\n\r\n4:10:46 Probably b isn't 20 degrees. :-D\r\n\r\n4:21:36 Not exactly the same. The distance from y=-p should be the absolute value of y+p, and then it would be the same. In this case, it isn't y+p, but -y-p.\r\n\r\n4:22:30 Or you could just swap x and y coordinates in the previous derivation, mirroring the image around y=x line.\r\n\r\n4:41:00 You probably mean absolute value of a difference. Otherwise you'd have only one branch.\r\n\r\n4:45:53 Not really. The equation below is more general, and holds for both branches, the equation you started with holds only for the right one.\r\n\r\n4:47:07 Less known fact, which really gives a nicer characterization: b is the difference from (any) focus to (any) asymptote.\r\n\r\n4:49:50 You might want to point out, in contrast to the ellipse and despite all the images you drew, it is _not_ the comparison between the axes that determines the orientation: in the ellipse, a is always bigger, in the hyperbola it doesn't have to be.\r\n\r\n4:57:00 All your rs are off by one. The inner circle (r=1) is barely visible, but it's obvious that the one you think is r=1 is not half of radius of the one that you think is r=2.\r\n\r\n5:02:33 You're mixing two different notions. One is _explicit equation_, where y=f(x), and another is _implicit equation_, where g(x,y)=0. Both are Cartesian in your sense. Not passing a vertical test is not the reason not to have Cartesian equation, as you yourself show few minutes later. Same mistake on 5:13:10.\r\n\r\n5:10:39 A really exaggerated one. It's 6 and 5, not 14 and 5. :-D\r\n\r\n5:11:19 We already do have a Cartesian equation for the circle before squaring. And squaring isn't always harmless, though it is in this example since r is positive.", "likes": 5}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy7E54NpkhKOlrqwdB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-06T03:20:28Z", "author": "RCE Males", "text": "i need more \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugza1JwPn4wHD3HKOF54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-06T01:58:56Z", "author": "Joseph Anthony", "text": "Is this the same calculus taught in highschool ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzy2-XPXSVrK83OChZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-06T01:14:03Z", "author": "mari", "text": "Please do a Calculus 1 course for another video.
