Currently, if the start of the ball image is just one pixel further left than the start of the paddle, it will not \"hit\" the paddle, although visually it should still be hitting it (and similar issue on the right side).  A good fix could be incorporating the width of the ball image (and splitting it in half):  if (...&& this.position.x - this.size / 2 >= leftSideOfPaddle && this.position.x + this.size / 2 <= rightSideOfPaddle).  This will allow it to still \"hit\" the paddle and bounce back if colliding with any part of the ball image from its center to its \"outer\" edge.\n\n(This difference is hard to appreciate on the original small ball, but if you did have a power-up like he mentioned and the ball got a lot larger, it would be easier to see and have more of an effect on gameplay.)", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz32S7kPIgfevthT5N4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-31T06:10:47Z", "author": "Web Developer", "text": "JavaScript Game \u2935\ufe0f\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCly_GAz2m-7FEdPgeS672nw/videos", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzMpa0b9VfB9BhWzsd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-26T00:32:50Z", "author": "BluTurtle", "text": "It says TypeError: Cannot read property \"getContext\" of null  when I do let ctx =  canvas.getContext('2d');", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzMpa0b9VfB9BhWzsd4AaABAg.9RUd3hGIyAQ9Uh3c6l4mQx", "publishedAt": "2021-11-13T19:17:55Z", "author": "Javier S\u00e1nchez", "text": "@Firegroupful Beautiful!", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzMpa0b9VfB9BhWzsd4AaABAg.9RUd3hGIyAQ9TqE-2VYoc_", "publishedAt": "2021-10-23T12:10:20Z", "author": "Firegroupful", "text": "You gotta connect the js file to the document under the canvas for it to work.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyaSLSBEVJ1x0HkYnB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-25T00:30:52Z", "author": "Justin", "text": "For the paddle to move 5 pixels every second wouldnt this.pos.x += 5 / (1000/delta) and not this.pos.x += 5 / delta?

This will request that your animation function be called before the browser performs the next repaint. The number of callbacks is usually 60 times per second, but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers as per W3C recommendation. requestAnimationFrame() calls are paused in most browsers when running in background tabs or hidden <iframe>s in order to improve performance and battery life.\r\n\r\nThe callback method is passed a single argument, a DOMHighResTimeStamp, which indicates the current time (based on the number of milliseconds since time origin). When multiple callbacks queued by requestAnimationFrame() begin to fire in a single frame, each receives the same timestamp even though time has passed during the computation of every previous callback's workload (in the code example below we only animate the frame when the timestamp changes, i.e. on the first callback). This timestamp is a decimal number, in milliseconds, but with a minimal precision of 1ms (1000 \u00b5s).", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxcGz3OVhcJ8s8LWmF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-08T20:30:02Z", "author": "Universal Flame Game", "text": "it doesn't work \ud83d\ude2d", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzy0iJwT4qk1TDAK2V4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-08T16:23:31Z", "author": "lanitoman", "text": "r u using processing js", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyNpOeC3sEUnY3Vfbp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-08T15:04:54Z", "author": "K T", "text": "If you're using local browser (I'm using browser-sync and Chrome on my local machine) and and index.html file with index.js and paddle.js you might run into the error I did:  \"index.js:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module\".

Always check that you have added export default properly to the file you're exporting.\n6. Sometimes VSCode will autofill for me and there will be no \".js\" at the end of the file path.
