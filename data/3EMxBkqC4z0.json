Currently, if the start of the ball image is just one pixel further left than the start of the paddle, it will not \"hit\" the paddle, although visually it should still be hitting it (and similar issue on the right side).  A good fix could be incorporating the width of the ball image (and splitting it in half):  if (...&& this.position.x - this.size / 2 >= leftSideOfPaddle && this.position.x + this.size / 2 <= rightSideOfPaddle).  This will allow it to still \"hit\" the paddle and bounce back if colliding with any part of the ball image from its center to its \"outer\" edge.\n\n(This difference is hard to appreciate on the original small ball, but if you did have a power-up like he mentioned and the ball got a lot larger, it would be easier to see and have more of an effect on gameplay.)", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Web Developer", "text": "JavaScript Game \u2935\ufe0f\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCly_GAz2m-7FEdPgeS672nw/videos", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "BluTurtle", "text": "It says TypeError: Cannot read property \"getContext\" of null  when I do let ctx =  canvas.getContext('2d');", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Javier S\u00e1nchez", "text": "@Firegroupful Beautiful!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Firegroupful", "text": "You gotta connect the js file to the document under the canvas for it to work.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Justin", "text": "For the paddle to move 5 pixels every second wouldnt this.pos.x += 5 / (1000/delta) and not this.pos.x += 5 / delta?

That makes no sense.  When the call stack is clear, the event loop is able to poll the event queue for new events, and if so, add them to the stack.   So you are right in a way, a while loop would result in an infinitely running call stack that never cleared, and is thus never able to grab anything from the event queue.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Kunal Singh Gusain", "text": "thanks for info buddy.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "unkn0wn R\u03b1ge", "text": "Are you fucking kidding dude, 1 hour of tutorial for this game which I used to play in 1990", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ricci Rich", "text": "Hi there\nWhat's the best way to get back to the Menu screen, and restart the game after you've lost all lives?", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "oo7moses", "text": "It's been a year.
