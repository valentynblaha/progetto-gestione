Thanks a lot! \nI have a question though, which is not exactly related to React but web dev in general. \nI am querying a third party API for the data, and just considering the pros and cons of setting up an autocomplete textbox as opposed to a normal textbox with a search button. The autocomplete way of doing this will obviously query the external API servers every single time I type something in the textbox. Now, even though that looks nice from the user's perspective, it probably is a lot more expensive on the servers. If it were my own servers, I wouldn't think much of it. But that isn't the case, hence my hesitation.\nI would really appreciate any help in choosing which route to take.

For instance if it was google there may be thousands of items in your array. So how could we modify this to send to a backend api and get back only like 7 results. Obviously you would have to send extra information into the class like the url and such. Would it be easy to change it so that is possible.
