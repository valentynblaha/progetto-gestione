Thanks a lot! \nI have a question though, which is not exactly related to React but web dev in general. \nI am querying a third party API for the data, and just considering the pros and cons of setting up an autocomplete textbox as opposed to a normal textbox with a search button. The autocomplete way of doing this will obviously query the external API servers every single time I type something in the textbox. Now, even though that looks nice from the user's perspective, it probably is a lot more expensive on the servers. If it were my own servers, I wouldn't think much of it. But that isn't the case, hence my hesitation.\nI would really appreciate any help in choosing which route to take.
