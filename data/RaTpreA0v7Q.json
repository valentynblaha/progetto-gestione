The instructor talks super duper slow and he rambles a lot, he spends a lot of time \"explaining\" things that don't even matter, he spent like 10 minutes explaining the React snippet extension, like seriously? It shouldn't have taken more than 5 seconds to explain, if that, even for an absolute beginner. I tried skipping parts of the video but even then I had to give up around the the two and half hour mark, and despite the video being over 9 hours long he still had to copy/paste the css code from the repo because he had to save time I guess(eye roll). \n\nI can say with great confidence that a good instructor like the Traversy Media guy, or Kyle from WebDevSimplified could have condensed this part to 10-20 minutes and explained it in a much clearer way. Some people have a talent for teaching, they know exactly what to say and do and always cut to the chase, others are the opposite of that, our friend right here is of the later kind I'm afraid.\n\nI feel like a huge asshole for saying this, here is this fine gentleman making a 9+ hours video for us free of charge, he probably spent a few days making and editing the video, yet here I'm complaining about it.
