You can easily create server side authentication with with middlewares (In Express) I have done this for my application before, I had client side protection and I also had a middleware which would check if the user is an admin or sign in and so on which would then send an error or give access depending on how the middleware evaluates.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzH9AMBRvTsSyKJ5VB4AaABAg.8mTWKZk8woY8mTrtuZablw", "publishedAt": "2018-10-16T19:24:38Z", "author": "Nick Karnik", "text": "You are correct about that. Normally, you will have client-side routes for a Single Page Application (SPA) and server-side routes (via API's) for SPA and Server Side Rendering (SSR). You need to ensure that the user has permissions to access both.  Even if the user managed to load a route on the client, the server should have another layer of verification where it won't return data if you're not authorized. In addition, your Data Access Layer and Database should have yet another level of verification as a safeguard. Does that answer your question?", "likes": 1}]}]}
