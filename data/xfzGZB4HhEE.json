What if you can write code that upon your stop loss sale, you place a limit order to buy back at the sale price? And then on the upside, you set a trailing stop loss (and if the trailing stop loss gets hit, you\u2019d also place a limit order to rebuy the stock at the stop loss price) This strategy essentially limits your downside and lets you participate more fully on the upside, and takes the \u201cart\u201d out of guessing the optimal stop loss and take profit price levels. I wonder if you\u2019ve ever considered this strategy and if you see any problems with it.

I skipped watching this video mainly due to the following reasons:\n\n1) You need to work on your typing skills!! Many times when you type more than two or three words, one of them ends up misspelled and you had to go back and fix it. You may also need to do more copy/paste.\n2) Your typing sound is disturbing.\n3) You insist on reading much useless information that we can already read from your screen! And this takes time making your video long (e.g. Onetime you read all the columns' long-names of your data table. Dude, we can read them by ourselves)\n4) You are going badly into details. Knowing how to prepare an excel file in python is totally off-topic for this specific course.\n5) You must do all your thinkings and make up your mind prior to start recording. I've seen a few moments that you have been lost! For instance, you were searching for an API endpoint in the docs and you didn't even know what keyword to search for!\n6) It would have been a better idea to split your video into different categories based on the course overview that you presented at the beginning of the video.\n7) Sometimes your webcam's stream is covering the code cells that you are explaining and this makes it difficult to follow up.\n\nGenerally speaking, you know what to do and you are an expert at it but it's better to consider publishing shorter videos with more information rather than long videos with less information.\n\nGood Luck", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyJAbC3PdEuIUOnyFl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-08T02:40:27Z", "author": "Thibaut Dunoyer", "text": "Hi, you should check this bot called Bit Robot who provides a daily passive income, so no hassle.

Here's my thought about this course.\u00a0\n\nI was following this course during the first project then fast-forwarded the rest of it. I can confirm it provides an ok depth of alg trading to the audiences who have no knowledge of alg trading. But seriously it would be great if the presenter is able to introduce some more trading algorithms even though just conceptually. I personally feel the presenter focuses too much on the implementation itself and most of the content is to demonstrate how to gather data from idx cloud. I know getting data is crucial but it has very little to do with trading. I don't see the point repeating data collection in all of the three projects. Overall, it is good but not great.
