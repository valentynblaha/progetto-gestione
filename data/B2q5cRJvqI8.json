In this tutorial you will go from having zero knowledge to writing an artificial intelligence that can compose Shakespearean prose.\n\nNo prior experience with deep learning is required, though it is always helpful to have more background information. We\u2019ll use a combination of embedding layers, recurrent neural networks, and fully connected layers to perform the classification. \n\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fCourse Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:16) Getting Started with Word Embeddings \n\u2328\ufe0f (33:25) How to Perform Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews \n\u2328\ufe0f (59:32) Let\u2019s Write An AI That Writes Shakespeare \n\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fCourse Description \u2b50\ufe0f\nThe basic idea behind natural language processing is that we start out with words, i.e. strings of characters, that are almost impossible for the computer to meaningfully parse. We can transform these strings into a vector in a higher dimensional space. Different words will be represented as vectors of different lengths and directions in this space, and this allows us to find relationships between words by finding the component of one vector along another. Don\u2019t worry, the TensorFlow library handles all of this, we just have to have some basic idea of how it works.\n\nSince this is a type of supervised learning, we also have labels for our text. This allows the AI to compare the relationships between words to the training labels, and learn which sequences of words represent good and bad movie reviews. This would also work for finding toxic comments, fake product reviews\u2026 just about anything for which we need a multiclass classification of text \u2013 provided we have enough training data and labels.\n\nThe last step in complexity is to change the final layer that handles the classification. This allows us to actually output text that the AI thinks is meaningful. What\u2019s really special about this is that the neural network starts out not even knowing that letters are a thing, or that we use spaces and punctuation, to producing something that approximates human level writing.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fCode \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 Word Embeddings: https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/blob/master/tf_embeddings.py\n\ud83d\udd17 Text Classification: https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/blob/master/tf_sentiment.py\n\ud83d\udd17Text Generation: https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/blob/master/tf_text_gen.py\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fResources \u2b50\ufe0f\nAs stated in the videos, these are from the official TensorFlow tutorials.

The tutorials I've found so far are either too simple and general, either too advanced (for me, at least). For example, I've just discovered stanfordonline's \"CS224N NLP with Deep Learning\", which is a great course but is kicking my bottom because I understand very little of the math behind it. \ud83d\ude43\n\n\nSince more and more people are becoming interested in NLP, we'll probably start seeing more tutorials soon. It will become easier to find something that fits our learning styles. Until that happens, I'll try to not get depressed watching the Stanford tutorials and seeing those students ask smart questions while I have to google every step of a simple back propagation formula . \ud83d\ude01", "likes": 5}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Kenzie7", "text": "I got my first job as a software engineer thanks to freeCodeCamp.
