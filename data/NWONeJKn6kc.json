I did not watch the entire video, but looked at the linear and logistic regression part. Firstly, the cost function he wrote for linear regression is wrong, 1/m is multiplied and not added to squared error terms. This is a big difference. Secondly, you do not optimize your cost function until it becomes close to zero, that is not practically possible with real world data, and if you were to do that it would mean your model will have absurdly high variance and would require insane number of polynomial features, not to mention that the model will be useless since it wouldn't generalize to new data at all.

I get that it gives us the average of whatever we sum next, but shouldn't it be irrelevant? We don't necessarily want a \"low\" cost function, we just want to \"lower\" it, if that makes sense.\n\nAs a simple example of what I'm trying to say, let's suppose we have, for the same model, two sets of parameters: \u03b81 and \u03b82\nlet's assume we have 5 data points to train with, and we get:\nJ(\u03b81) = 2.34\nJ(\u03b82) = 5.34\nThus \u03b81 is the best set of parameters out of the two.\nNow let's use, for the same scenario, a cost function without the average (no 1/m). Because we have 5 data points, we can achieve this by simply multiplying the previous cost functions by 5:\nJ(\u03b81) = 11.7\nJ(\u03b82) = 26.7\nSo, great, our cost functions increased, but that's completely irrelevant, because what we really care about is the relative improvement from one set of parameters to the other, i.e., \u03b81 is still about 2.28x better than \u03b82", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzA8VhjOXfNpLSHnId4AaABAg.9XxWmhsszCY9ZUgeORofz0", "publishedAt": "2022-03-12T21:15:21Z", "author": "Claire Boitet", "text": "We should multiply by 1/m, not add it, it's an error, that's all.", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgydQRd97Kc65-GWltV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-02T08:47:53Z", "author": "Capuccino Pintucciono", "text": "I just want to point out, while this course is amazing, and it's crazy how much this dude knows (I mean, he looks like 16 years old or something), there's quite a lot of inaccuracies in the equations and way he formulates problems.

I will make another comment should I found your video really make sense to people outside the statistic environment (I think that is what AI/ML) is closest to ... especially to myself with relatively good background in real life application of automation. I wish to see a video that shows a simple application of AI/ML with the tools (required hardware) related to the hands on of it rather than having a dodgy introduction of all the alient jargons of the subject. Know little still better than nothing. Let's start with a simple application that can be hands on and put into practice.  You can use the wow factor there on to move forward from that example.

The optimal value of \u03b8 would remain the same in both cases.\n\nThe expression for the gradient becomes prettier with the 1/2, because the 2 from the square term cancels out.\n\nThe m is useful if you solve this problem with gradient descent. Then your gradient becomes the average of m terms instead of a sum, so its' scale does not change when you add more data points.\n\nThe 1/2 is for convenience; it makes the derivative, which is the function actually being optimized, look nicer. The 1/m is more fundamental; it suggests that we are interested in the mean squared error. This allows you to make fair comparisons when changing the sample size, and prevents overflow. \n\nI accept, it should be 1/2m but I was talking about MSE, but still I would have added that, So Sorry. \n\n2.)

But as I  didn't say it can't be written as (1/m)*sum(...) but that it can't be written  as (1/m)+sum(...), as you  wrote in  the video, please don't accuse me of saying that (1/m)*sum(...) is wrong and of misguiding others as you did.\n\nThe 1/m is there because we are taking an average of the square of the errors (and usually taken as 1/2m because the derivative of the square of the errors gives a factor 2), therefore, it makes no sense to add a 1/m which is added to the sum as part of a cost function as it has nothing to do with the distance between the hypothesis and the data.\n\n2) The partial derivative in respect to x of the cost function as you wrote it,\n\nJ = 1/m + sum((h(x)-y)^2)\n\nCANNOT be, \n\ndJ/dx = 2/m + sum((h(x)-y)^2)\n\nas you wrote it. \n\n(i) The partial derivative of 1/m in respect to x is 0 and not 2/m. And no, as you wrote it as two desperate terms, the factor 2 from the power 2 doesn't multiply the 1/m term in YOUR cost function.\n\n(ii) The partial derivative of sum((h(x)-y)^2) CANNOT be sum((h(x)-y)^2). It is 2*sum(h(x)-y)*dh(x)/dx\n\nEven if you fix the '+' to a '\u00d7' it won't change the fact that the partial derivative of f(x)^2 in respect to x cannot be f(x)^2, but is 2\u00d7f(x)\u00d7df(x)/dx.

Oh! Sorry how would u know you have a mindset of 1900s. Our parents aren't forcing we are learning bcz we are passionate. Like you I don't believe in learning by age. Anyone can learn anything at any age. You don't have any rights to judge us. I have taught over 100+ students including professors at universities and also I am 16 y/o. I am passionate about technology that's why I learnt and leveraged up my skills. Because of ur mentality kids are ignored and underestimated. If you can't see our success then close ur eyes don't demotivate any of us and we all are self taught I didn't spent a penny learning AR/VR, Web Development, App Development, Game Development & Quantum Computing. I worked as an AR/VR Developer for a year at a startup. Also in India 14+ years of kids can work at tech industry if you don't have any knowledge of law then learn it before saying it.\n\nCoding & Software Development made my life it didn't ruined and you need not to think of us think about yourself what you will do, we are doing good in our fields.\n\nFrom now on stop demotivating all the kids you guys don't even know what we all kids are capable of. You might have just stuck on ur school subjects but we are more than that.\n\nWe don't waste our time like u guys watching worthless TV Shows we use that time to learn and develop.
