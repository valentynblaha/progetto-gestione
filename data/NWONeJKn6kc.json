Secondly, you do not optimize your cost function until it becomes close to zero, that is not practically possible with real world data, and if you were to do that it would mean your model will have absurdly high variance and would require insane number of polynomial features, not to mention that the model will be useless since it wouldn't generalize to new data at all.

Because we have 5 data points, we can achieve this by simply multiplying the previous cost functions by 5:\nJ(\u03b81) = 11.7\nJ(\u03b82) = 26.7\nSo, great, our cost functions increased, but that's completely irrelevant, because what we really care about is the relative improvement from one set of parameters to the other, i.e., \u03b81 is still about 2.28x better than \u03b82", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Claire Boitet", "text": "We should multiply by 1/m, not add it, it's an error, that's all.", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Capuccino Pintucciono", "text": "I just want to point out, while this course is amazing, and it's crazy how much this dude knows (I mean, he looks like 16 years old or something), there's quite a lot of inaccuracies in the equations and way he formulates problems.

But as mentioned already, this was not the error I was pointing out.\n\n2) I see that you corrected your errata to remove the erroneous power 2.

The optimal value of \u03b8 would remain the same in both cases.\n\nThe expression for the gradient becomes prettier with the 1/2, because the 2 from the square term cancels out.\n\nThe m is useful if you solve this problem with gradient descent. Then your gradient becomes the average of m terms instead of a sum, so its' scale does not change when you add more data points.\n\nThe 1/2 is for convenience; it makes the derivative, which is the function actually being optimized, look nicer. The 1/m is more fundamental; it suggests that we are interested in the mean squared error. This allows you to make fair comparisons when changing the sample size, and prevents overflow. \n\nI accept, it should be 1/2m but I was talking about MSE, but still I would have added that, So Sorry. \n\n2.) When you take out the Partial derivative of the formula that I have written, it will be :- \n\n= 1/m \u03a3 i = 1 ^ m * \u2202/\u2202 theta_0 (y^hat - y_{i})\n= 1/m \u03a3 i = 1 ^ m * 2(y^hat - y_{i})*\u2202/\u2202 theta_0 (y^hat - y_{i}) \n= 2/m *   \u03a3 i = 1 ^ m (y^hat - y_{i}) \n\nand here is the answer.

I've seen other people do it). \n\nAs I said, the pronunciation issues are not critical. Nevertheless, it would be good to fix them.\n\n1) Can you please send me a link where the cost function is defined as,\n(1/m) +sum(...)\nas you wrote it in the video and not,\n(1/2m)*sum(...) or (1/m)*sum(...)?\n\nAnd if you meant that it could be written as (1/m)*sum(...), yes it can, no argument about that. But as I  didn't say it can't be written as (1/m)*sum(...) but that it can't be written  as (1/m)+sum(...), as you  wrote in  the video, please don't accuse me of saying that (1/m)*sum(...) is wrong and of misguiding others as you did.\n\nThe 1/m is there because we are taking an average of the square of the errors (and usually taken as 1/2m because the derivative of the square of the errors gives a factor 2), therefore, it makes no sense to add a 1/m which is added to the sum as part of a cost function as it has nothing to do with the distance between the hypothesis and the data.\n\n2) The partial derivative in respect to x of the cost function as you wrote it,\n\nJ = 1/m + sum((h(x)-y)^2)\n\nCANNOT be, \n\ndJ/dx = 2/m + sum((h(x)-y)^2)\n\nas you wrote it. \n\n(i) The partial derivative of 1/m in respect to x is 0 and not 2/m. And no, as you wrote it as two desperate terms, the factor 2 from the power 2 doesn't multiply the 1/m term in YOUR cost function.\n\n(ii) The partial derivative of sum((h(x)-y)^2) CANNOT be sum((h(x)-y)^2). It is 2*sum(h(x)-y)*dh(x)/dx\n\nEven if you fix the '+' to a '\u00d7' it won't change the fact that the partial derivative of f(x)^2 in respect to x cannot be f(x)^2, but is 2\u00d7f(x)\u00d7df(x)/dx. So even your errata 1 is wrong, because in it you write that the partial derivative is,\n\n(2/m)*sum((h(x)-y)^2) (\"... $\\frac{2}{m} *  \\sum  \\limits _{i = 1} ^{m} (\\Theta^{T}x^{i} - y^{i})^{2}$ ...\", https://github.com/ayush714/ML001-Project-Sources-Code-and-Learning-Materials/blob/main/ML001%20Other%20Materials/Errata%20In%20ML001%20Course.md)\n\nand not,\n\n(2/m)*sum(h(x)-y)*dh(x)/dx \n\nas the partial derivative of your cost function (i.e., without the factor 2) should be.
