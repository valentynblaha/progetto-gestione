However, I think you missed one of the more common patterns involving rebase and merge.  In your case of an LT branchA and work branchB with changes on both you rebased the changes in branchA on the changes in branchB.   In my experience, it is more common to rebase the changes in branchB on the changes in branchA (checkout branchB, rebase branchA, <resolve conflicts, build, test>, commit) then merge the resolved changes back into branchA (checkout branchA, merge branchB).  That final merge MUST be a fast-forward.  If it isn't, start over.  This completely avoids the problem of rewriting history on branchA that you alluded to.
