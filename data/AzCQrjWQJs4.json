You can also check out the interactive version of the course here: https://scrimba.com/g/gdropbox\n\nDropbox is a content and collaboration platform trusted by more than 500 million users and 300,000 teams. It also has an API which allows you to add Dropbox features to your apps, such as file storage, sharing, previews, and search.\n\nOne example of such an app is an expense organizer, which can help businesses prevent their receipts from turning into chaos. Each employee simply adds their receipts to a Dropbox folder, and then the app takes care of organizing them.\n\nIn this course, you'll build this organizer app while learning the fundamentals of working with the Dropbox APIs. It will all be done in plain JavaScript. Along the way you'll also learn several ES6 concepts, like array methods and async/await functions.\n\nTo learn more about the Dropbox API, visit the docs: https://www.dropbox.com/developers\n\nCourse created by Christian Jensen.\n\ud83d\udc26https://twitter.com/cbejensen\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT53M18S", "likes": "607", "views": "35915"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyTE3QBtZOInbFeJOd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-11-05T10:32:05Z", "author": "Ejay Velasco", "text": "Is this available for lua script??", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzaL2DdzVSAagfhDqd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-19T06:02:28Z", "author": "Logic Monster", "text": "stuck in require is not defined \n\nsome instructors explain to us like we r a senior developers", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyWeGZiQqOxQ-8VxBN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-09-09T05:06:23Z", "author": "TITAN \u2714", "text": "Is the dropbox access token short lived?how long does it be valid", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyWeGZiQqOxQ-8VxBN4AaABAg.9fk0ds_zf5e9g8eqclXbWP", "publishedAt": "2022-09-19T04:07:24Z", "author": "Ankit Raj", "text": "4h", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzZJ3JhGcqxtjyNPhN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-16T05:06:04Z", "author": "nikluz", "text": "Nice.
