The decrease on that line was to ensure that the life variable is always given a value that is 0 or above. A Math.abs would correct for your use case however that is just adding to the processing. Honestly though, I'm bored so I'm just looking at re-writing this whole tutorial without jQuery and using classes... this small life system is part of the least of what I would change.\n\nI'm thinking egg class that has a collision method for any object, a chicken class that you apply layEgg() and it generates new eggs then iterates over them, and a game class that allows for progression with additional chickens being added through longer gameplay / increased score.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Kir Kanos", "text": "life = Math.max(0, life);\nif you already have decremented it.
