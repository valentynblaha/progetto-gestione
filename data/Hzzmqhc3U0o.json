I used loops in many of my bonfire solutions.\n\nYou don't need to understand everything here - just know that loops exist when you need to traverse a set of data and they can cut down on the amount of code you need to write.", "duration": "PT51S", "likes": "78", "views": "10515"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwaayGr9VXbTOvlbfx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-25T22:39:45Z", "author": "Onome Lemmy-Ughegbe", "text": "I enjoyed this.
