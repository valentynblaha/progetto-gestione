However, you are incorrect to say 'a map is not a javascript object'. A map is a JavaScript Object. To prove it, try running this JavaScript code: `var m = new Map(); m instanceof Object` and you will see that a map is technically an object.

The main one is so you can use the terminology generally associated with maps. (which is 'size') Also, as a general practice, it is good to access variables stored in an object through functions. This allows you to make easier changes in the future to how the value is calculated or possibly only return the variable if certain conditions are met.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Good Wish", "text": "Very good explanation.
