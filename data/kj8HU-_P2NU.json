For example. \nlet dontMutateThisArray = [a,b,c,d,e,f,g];\n  lets say we wanna make a copy and mutate it. \nlet shouldIMutateThis = dontMutateThisArray;\nI want to change a copy of this array but it is a refrence type meaning if we did  change this array it will change the original array anyway because the copied variable is just pointing still to the original variable. Thus changing what you might have thought was a different object. \nshouldIMutateThis.slice(0, 1);\nwill change dontMutateThisArray \nSo to make a true copy that has nothing to do with the original use ...objectToBeCopied\nFor this example we are using an array so\n let iCanMutateThisSafely = [...dontMutateThisArray];\nNow you can do whatever you want and maintain the original, this is the way all functional programming should be done, preserve the original and mutate the copy. \nHope this helps, this is what I know if I got anything wrong feel free to correct me.\n\n\nThat only answers what it does, what he is doing here is something more advanced on top of this spread operator, which Im still learning obviously since Im here.
