I am currently gearing up to implement microfrontends in my projects at work, but as with other videos in the scene currently yu have not dug into how they are hosted and shared via real environments once deployed. I have hazarded some guesses. In the Webpack configs we point to where the remote projects are hosted (locally (localhost) on in your tutorial) is it safe to safe we just need to point at where we store them once deployed, for me this would be in the nginx folder, nginx/build/project files (index.js).\n\nCheers", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyN3prKKzkN075aEk94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-01T05:25:51Z", "author": "HaoLux", "text": "Can you give me theme vscode", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzju3I9LbyHC6qGwtR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-01T05:25:31Z", "author": "HaoLux", "text": "Can you give me vscode", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwCNkZY7ag0ua6xYAB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-23T14:09:34Z", "author": "Sebastian Paniagua Isaza", "text": "Just for anyone who's dealing with an error when adding reac-router-dom, I've just find out that Switch is no longer Supported.
