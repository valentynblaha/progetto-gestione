That leaves you with 8 teams which need to be coordinated to handle the contract change. Technical coordination of 8 teams ... do you have any idea how expensive that is?\n\nSo in essence, shared components in your context is NOT a positive feature.\nObviously, it can be rooted out with the O from SOLID.
