I've figured this one out. In the main game blueprint, after Event Tick, disconnect the collapsed graph named \"Wait\" and move it to just after 'Check inputs' and before 'Move snake'. Connect the nodes again. Next, open the collapsed graph 'Spawn new snake part' and disconnect the return value after 'SpawnActorLocation'. Drag off from the return value and type 'Vector - int'. set the integer value to '1' and connect the return value to the Spawn location on 'Spawn new snake part' blueprint.
