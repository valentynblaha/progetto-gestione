This was also no the first time, somewhere in the video you could also use an interface instead of a class. \n\nAnd secondly, almost all your properties are public, and yes I understand with PHP being a dynamically typed language it is easy, to store the variables in a string array and dynamically get/set the value like that, you could still make the properties private (or at least protected) and use 1 global setter/getter per class and pass the name of the property as an extra parameter and get or set the value like that.\n\nand last, although this might be subjective, your classes have very high coupling between them, which could probably also be improved.\n\nEDIT:\nI just want to say, even though I 'criticized' the OOP way, I still enjoyed this video, and would recommend it, I learned a lot.
