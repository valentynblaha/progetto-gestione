I hope it helps others:\n\n1) I used this video and practice exams from Udemy(hashicorp certified: Terraform associate practice exam 2022 (which sucked by the way)) as resources. Nothing more. I didn't skip parts of the video and I've paid attention. I studied for 7 days (01/Mar to 07/Mar).\n\n2) The exam kicked my ass and I had several questions about topics that I had not seen either in this video or the practice exams.\n\n3) I had several questions that required knowledge about the details.. (\"what would happen if X was done after Y in the situation W\" kind of questions).  Although I also had a LOT of brain dead question (\"what is the first command you run to initialize xxxx?\")\n\n4) I distinctly remember being quietly pissed off during my exam by the sheer number of questions I've had not seen in either materials I've used to study. It was the first time I had that experience.\n\n5) I had about 2 \"fill the blank by typing\" questions, about 15 \"true or false\" and the rest were regular questions. I felt really unprepared for the \"true or false\" ones since they often asked about some obscure detail I had not been told about.\n\n6)I've passed by the skin of my teeth with 72% - the lowest score I've ever had in a certification.  I had enough time to go through the questions 2 times and really think about my answers. The ones I got wrong I absolutely had no knowledge about.\n\n7) The 2 \"fill the blank by typing\" questions were \"what flag do you use when using the command *Terraform XXXX*  to have Y behavior?\". Super simple stuff. It's just a gimmick. (I'll not get into details since I've agreed to not divulge the test)\n\n8) It is amazing how many questions about \"what is/are the benefit(s) of IaC?\" They can come up with. There were at least 7 in my exam in different flavors. They are really keen on selling their solution and the answer is not super clear sometimes. \n\n9) Hashicorp does not play around and I respect them a lot for that. All questions were pretty direct and there were no tricky questions. Either you know or you don't.\n\nMy conclusion:\nThis is a great(free!) course and it got me through my certification. I will not complain about it. I thank the creator and will send him a $$ contribution asap. But DO NOT believe the comments saying this is an easy certification that you can pass half asleep.  In my opinion, It was as hard as my aws solutions architect associate (and I got a 92% on that one!)\nPlease read the documentation available on hashicorp's website or use other courses to supplement this one.  \n\nReading the comments here and on other sites I was sure this exam was going to be easy as hell.. it was NOT. Don't make the same mistake I did. ;)", "likes": 28}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwepJkrp5sUJRqDEUR4AaABAg.9ZI7lB9A8Gi9fNB0wM4eGH", "publishedAt": "2022-08-30T22:55:17Z", "author": "Asia Thorpe", "text": "Hi David, do you (or anyone else) know of a resource, Udemy or otherwise, that would have better practice exams?
