Sadly this is no long true... you are constantly shown videos that either the same video you just watched or similar ones.... or worse shown the same videos day in and day out for weeks if you dont reject them.  I often go through and check the dont recommend channel on a whole page of videos hit the reload button and hope for better choices. \n\nSo would it be possible to make a chrome extension that could automate this process in some way such as take the fist 10 or however many videos presented and  do the dont recommend channel for each and then reload the page.

If you add   newVideoLoaded(); at the end of contentScript as the purposed quick fix, the extension won't work properly on reload. The reason is that you will not get the video ID into the currentVideo variable, so you won't be able to add new timestamps. The best quick fix I came up with was to force a new URL (I also studied how YouTube deals with different URLs) and I came up with this code that you can add to your contentScript in the place of newVideoLoaded() (the one at the end, line 64 of the finished code);\n\nlet trail=\"&ytExt=ON\";\r\nif(!window.location.href.includes(trail)&&!window.location.href.includes(\"ab_channel\")){\r\n        window.location.href+=trail;\r\n   }\n\nThis should force an update on the URL of the YouTube when necessary, which will then trigger the chrome.tabs.onUpdated. I hope this helps. (For those who want to know what is ab_channel, it is something youtube adds spontaneously for some videos (with channel info) and that triggers the chrome.tabs.onUpdated on its own.) Cheers!\n\nEDIT!!\n\nAlso include a condition &&window.location.href.includes(\"youtube.com/watch\") in the if statement i gave.
