I've seen the complaint that they aren't as readable as ifs, but I happen to like them (as long as there's no nesting or really weird stuff going on).  For example at about 7:00 lines 104 to 108 could be, \n\nconst portfolio = employee.type === 'manager' ? employee.getMBAProjects() : employee.getGithubLink();\n\nand you would retain the use of const.  But, would this be considered \"clean\"? As a newer programmer, these nuances are tough to figure out, so thanks for these videos.", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"author": "Ugotsta", "text": "Good point. I think ternary operators would have been a problem in the past for the many people who hadn't seen them yet but the world's changing fast as noticed even in this video with the arrow functions, lets and consts.\n\nOne issue with ternary operators though, if you've never seen them before, it can be difficult to find an explanation. It was for me some years back. It took me a moment to realize the question mark could be an operator so I was able to find an explanation at that point but it was very confusing prior.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Beau Carnes", "text": "I also like ternary operators. I often use them in place of if statements.
