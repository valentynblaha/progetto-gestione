The owner of the account would have to go to his email, follow the link, change his password and login again every single time someone does \"forgot password request\", because of the lock. \n  What you ACTUALY need to do is logout user from once he FOLLOWED the link to change his password but didnt send a new one, than its okay to logout and lock account untill the user changes his password. OR if user followed the link AND changed the password, than we could just logout(without locking obviously) and send him to login page/login right away depending on frontend setup.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxAok69xxSabHpqvFV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-01-31T17:29:39Z", "author": "ebunoluwa abiona", "text": "Hello, i cannot find the video link you mentioned in [09:03] that should explain the tsconfig.json file.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyyyNVs7UD2XKoc9TV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-10-07T22:17:59Z", "author": "jesus sanchez", "text": "Hi all, I have a error\nDo you think you can help me?\n\nC:\\Users\\jd_sa\\Documents\\GitHub\\gym-box-server\\node_modules\\ts-node\\src\\index.ts:200\n    throw new TSError(formatDiagnostics(configDiagnostics, cwd, ts, 0))\n          ^\nTSError: \u2a2f Unable to compile TypeScript\nUnknown compiler option 'strictFunctionTypes'.
