RSA + SHA256 = RSA256 = RSA-SHA256 = RS256\n2. RSA is the algorithm to encrypt the hashed message. And SHA256 is an algorithm to create the hashed text from the original text.\n3. There are three ways you could create JWT in this tutorial:\n  i)  using base nodejs crypto library(Zach has shown only how to encrypt and decrypt and sign a message with this, though if you understand this well then you can create JWT for yourself)\n  ii)using signatureFunction. This is where I personally found myself a little uneasy about the use of crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256') without much explanation of this line. Actually, the signature function does both the things in the background i.e. hashing and then encrypting. For hashing we want it to use SHA256 and for encrypting RSA. Hence we provide RSA256 as a combination of the two in the crypto.createSign method!\n  iii)  using jsonwebtoken npm library (very easy way to implement). The passport-jwt strategy also uses this library in the hindsight!", "likes": 29}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bitcoin Graffiti", "text": "58:26 I'm not sure we have to put the error handler after app.get().
