The new version will not pass props to the class component by default like what was done in the tutorial.  My solution to this issue was to change the class component into a functional component and use React and React Router hooks. \n\nI have added all the code in SingleRoom.js that should fix the issue at this point in the video (along with some comments explaining the process):\n\n------- SingleRoom.js ---------\n// import the useContext hook from 'react', no need for Component since we are using an RFC\r\nimport React, { useContext} from 'react'\r\nimport defaultBcg from '../images/room-1.jpeg'\r\nimport Hero from '../components/Hero'\r\nimport Banner from '../components/Banner'\r\n\r\n// import the useParams hook from React Router\r\nimport {Link, useParams} from 'react-router-dom'\r\nimport { RoomContext } from '../context'\r\n\r\n// Transform the RCC to an RFC\r\nexport default function SingleRoom() {\r\n    // Get the slug using React Router's useParams hook\r\n    const { slug } = useParams();\r\n    \r\n    // Get the context we defined in context.js using React's useContext hook\r\n    const context = useContext(RoomContext);\r\n\r\n    // Similar to the tutorial, we access the getRoom function through our context (no need for 'this')\r\n    const { getRoom } = context;\r\n\r\n    // Get the room object that matches our slug like in the tutorial (no need to access state)\r\n    const room = getRoom(slug);\r\n\r\n    // Other than no longer needing the render function, everything else should be the same as in the tutorial\r\n    if (!room){\r\n      return <div className='error'>\r\n        <h3>no such room could be found</h3>\r\n        <Link to='/rooms' className='btn-primary'>\r\n          back to rooms\r\n        </Link>\r\n      </div>\r\n    }\r\n    const {name, description, capacity, size, price, extras, breakfast, pets, images} = room;\r\n    return (\r\n      <Hero hero='roomsHero'>\r\n        <Banner title={`${name} room`}>\r\n          <Link to=\"/rooms\" className='btn-primary'>\r\n            back to rooms\r\n          </Link>\r\n        </Banner>\r\n      </Hero>\r\n    )\r\n  }\n\nHope this helps! It seems the latest trend in React is to use functional components instead of class components in many places, filling in any functionality gaps with hooks.

Other comments below had solutions that helped me, but I thought I would go a step further and show all the code in App.js and index.js that should fix this issue at this point in the video:\n\n------ App.js ------\nimport React from \"react\"\r\nimport './App.css';\r\nimport Home from \"./pages/Home\";\r\nimport Rooms from \"./pages/Rooms\";\r\nimport SingleRoom from \"./pages/SingleRoom\";\r\nimport Error from \"./pages/Error\";\r\nimport { Routes, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <Navbar />\r\n      <Routes> \r\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" element={<Home/>}/>\r\n        <Route exact path=\"/rooms\" element={ <Rooms/>}/>\r\n        <Route exact path=\"/rooms/:slug\" element={<SingleRoom/>}/>     \r\n        <Route path=\"*\" element={ <Error/>}/>\r\n      </Routes>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n\n\n-----  index.js ----\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';\r\n// import './index.css';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(\r\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\r\n);\r\n\r\nroot.render(\r\n  <Router>\r\n    <App />    \r\n  </Router>\r\n);\n\nLater on when you encounter <Link to=\"/\"> for instance, it should still work as it did when this tutorial first came out. Once you are around 2:33:00, you will run into another issue with the new version of React Router not passing props to the class component by default.
