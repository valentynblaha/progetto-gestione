Here are some updates from @FrankJacquette:\n- Firebase no longer offers a free tier. You will have to set up an account and provide a credit card to use Firebase functions.\n- The current version of Busboy has broken the API described in the video. I recommend modifying your code to use the current version.\n- React-router-dom has API-breaking changes since the video was made. I recommend downgrading to version 5.x.\n- The instructor will occasionally introduce a bug in his work and repair it later. If your code isn't working, watch a little longer before assuming it's your issue.\n- The Redux code as implemented will cause an infinite page refresh loop under some circumstances.  Clearing local storage and reloading the page will bypass this.\n- componentWillReceiveProps is deprecated and should be replaced with componentDidUpdate. There are several good pages out there describing how to do this.\n- Material UI has gone through a major version release since the video was produced.  While everything in the video will continue to work, the documentation you'll find is for the current version of MUI and will be slightly different. Also, Grid has slightly different parameters.\n\n- \n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT12H5M31S", "likes": "25060", "views": "1015788"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyXZSWRLimK6ybOWf54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-19T23:14:48Z", "author": "Tim", "text": "For those finding this in 2022/23 yes firebase isn't free anymore, but it also isn't very expensive is you are just doing this for a tutorial (maybe you'll spend a few bucks if you query the DB enough but generally it wont cost you anything unless you try to launch your app to the public). Secondly, firebase has made some changes and a few things here don't work quite the same as they did when this video was made.

Why using the Image upload on a cloud function when you can use it storage upload on the front-end ???\n4. fileName.split(\".\")[fileName.split(\".\").length -1 ]   (Why use the same execution twice instead saving the split result?)\n5. using a global variable for a token is a bad idea , you cloud pass it around with the promise response..\n6.
