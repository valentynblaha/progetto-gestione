Here are some updates from @FrankJacquette:\n- Firebase no longer offers a free tier. You will have to set up an account and provide a credit card to use Firebase functions.\n- The current version of Busboy has broken the API described in the video. I recommend modifying your code to use the current version.\n- React-router-dom has API-breaking changes since the video was made. I recommend downgrading to version 5.x.\n- The instructor will occasionally introduce a bug in his work and repair it later. If your code isn't working, watch a little longer before assuming it's your issue.\n- The Redux code as implemented will cause an infinite page refresh loop under some circumstances.  Clearing local storage and reloading the page will bypass this.\n- componentWillReceiveProps is deprecated and should be replaced with componentDidUpdate. There are several good pages out there describing how to do this.\n- Material UI has gone through a major version release since the video was produced.  While everything in the video will continue to work, the documentation you'll find is for the current version of MUI and will be slightly different. Also, Grid has slightly different parameters.\n\n- \n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT12H5M31S", "likes": "24961", "views": "1009174"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Omkar Dhumal", "text": "I have one qurey , how do i make admin panel on this project ,if i want tract which new user has joined and what post they created , so that admin can i track in-appropiate post made by user , delete it right away .
