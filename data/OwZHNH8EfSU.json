Some might think that I should not focus on such low aspects but AI Principles are highly important. You said that AI should incorporate or reinforce existing Societal Stereotypes. Now here's what I understood from it that AI systems should not be generalized rather they should be community specific. It can be assumed as the AI system should contain multiple subsections each focussing on one certain community and they all together will form a fair system which treats every person equally. For instance assume Person A belongs to Community A and Person B belongs to community B, so when they will be using our AI system, it should feel like a system which specializes in the ethics of their community beliefs and it is completely agreeing with whatever the person is saying or doing. In other words when Person A is using our AI, he/she should have the feeling that AI is believing in whatever the person is doing and similarly when person B is using it should resemble them the same. AI should not counter any one's argument even though Community A has a completely opposite thinking as Community B.
