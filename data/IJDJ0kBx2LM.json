{"video": {"id": "IJDJ0kBx2LM", "title": "Recursion in Programming - Full Course", "description": "Recursion is a powerful technique that helps us bridge the gap between complex problems being solved with elegant code. Within this course, we will break down what recursion is, why you would and wouldn\u2019t want to use it and look at a variety of examples for how it can be used.\n\nWe\u2019ll break down recursion with all sorts of data-structures, animations, debugging and call-stack analysis to get a deeper understanding to these principles.\n\nThe code is written in Java, but the principles are agnostic to any language. \n\n\u270f\ufe0f This course was developed by The Simple Engineer.

My question is once we hit the base condition and now there is no more method calls, so when we execute the first method call in the stack, how does the process know like it doesn't have to call the method again and has to execute it and popped it out of the stack memory ?\n\nFor e.g., Your example when we do string reversal, now the base condition is if string is empty then no need of method call, but once we hit that base condition there is a method on stack (reverseString(\"o\") + \"l\"), how does the process know that it has to execute that method and pop out rather than making another method call ?
