Some C++/ Java/Python libs too to build your engine. Too many cooks spoil the broth as they say with all these game engines popping up, il wait 5 years see if any stand out and can make my game dev easier quicker cross plat and do exactly what the main stays do but better then il think about it otherwise Im just learning another Engine for no real reason when I could be honing my skills I've already built up to make me faster? Kind of like of like a swap drag n drop environment where its pre built you just swap the assets with yours so games look different but function the same like platformers all look similar so make a template and just swap with pre built sprites kinda mix n match, same goes for top down rpg. Yes I know we already have useful templates, but think Mario maker game engine and drag and drop everything, maybe that's just lazyness and no real effort or progress?

I enjoyed a little SDL and SFML just to get my engine library knowledge up a little with C++, even creating your own engine in C or Python will help for using future libraries and engines etc. Godot is really picking up speed but still not the finished article, it's cementing itself as no.3 engine especially for beginners as a lot like GDScript, myself I prefer C#, lovely language, C++ in unreal doesn't do it for me compared to C#, I think blueprints is ok but has limitations, a mix of both os fine as blueprints can turn into spaghetti real fast. I really wished UE5 used C# tho. Godots GDScript has influenced UE5s scripting. It's hard to tell 5-10 yeara from who will be on top, but whomever has easiest scripting, using Mobile in 2D/3D, Desktop/Console, XR compatability Hololens/MetaVerse etc plus WebXR will do the best I think. I do think though as Ive just noticed with Unity maybe trying to do too much it leaves other devs behind, I waited nearly 2 years to use the remote 5 with new UI touch/joystick, as they are too focused on catching UE. Unity should have stuck to mobile/portable/Desktop/XR, and let UE focus on High End Desktop/XR, who knows puting all ur eggs in one basket can be dangerous! I got burned with Google Daydream should have chosen Oculus but would have eventually, lost over a year tho, so yeah better doing more than one proj at a time. \u270c", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzBt_cNa9enEZF4_PZ4AaABAg.9XyJ5uzMRD39aNfFo9zHyB", "publishedAt": "2022-04-28T20:51:13Z", "author": "Ahmad", "text": "tbh learning this is nothing compared to any other game engine, really simple and fast did it under 2 weeks.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyfAqFRMyVIPtuzBkN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-02T23:48:01Z", "author": "Clement Wee", "text": "The GDevelop projects screen seems different.
