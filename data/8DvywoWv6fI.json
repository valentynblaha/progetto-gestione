About the same time I learned electronics and soldering and made my own ultrasonic detector in just 2 weeks of learning while I was waiting for my components to arrive.\nBut ever since then my learning capabilities, patience to learn, remember and and apply any instructions from tutorials went completely blank to the point I cant even have attention to read tutorials unless they are short and have bullet points. I cannot read and remember books anymore.\n\nBut I love trying to learn Python because its kinda Simple like Basic although not quite. I would also like to learn Java and Javascrypt and C... but Im getting lost in all the syntax, brackets, nesting and indentations. I realy find it cool looking and ofcourse useful knowledge but I just cant seem to remember it and I quickly loose focus and alertness. It may be because Im working 8 hours a day in logistics and Im coming home tired and going straight to bed. Because I know for a fact that.. when I dodnt have a job.. I could be rested and have focus all night and I was able to follow tutorials and make a calculator in Python and learn al the basics within an hour and finish a project within 4 hours and compile it into an exe and that small achievement would realy make me enthusiastic and proud. (Im 36 now BTW). \n\nAlso I would like to mention that this lesson is extremely easy to follow and easy to learn. The only other I found to be as easy to understand as thos one was from a youtuber DevEd. I would also like to mention that I find it much easier to learn languages (on Duolingo and Drops apps). Like Chinese, Hebrew, Dutch, etc. I can quickly connect the dots and remember like 300 new words per day as a minimum). \n\nAlso at work, I deal with inventory management, picking and packing. Im able to combine a huge amount of codes for using and combining different operations for transfering produce, investigating and solving mistakes, as well as having a superhuman speed of doing  all that, quickly reading numbers and codes on quick moving packages. Remembering thousands of different color codes and clothes styles codes and their corresponding color shades. Multitasking by setting a dozens of different working memories in my mind all at the same time. Which is needed when loading inbound pallets, and cartons with produce and setting them aside or putting them away on shelves, all separated by their delivery numbers, while at the same time keeping in my mind where are they physically located and where do they belong. While at the same time communicating with my coworkers in several different languages. .. Yet Im unable to remember how to type a simple python function.. after years of occasional learning from tutorials and doing some practice projects..... Even though I would love so much to have a knack for coding and to find it easy and to not have discalculia and to be a math genius..... But I guess I will have to give up on it... since I dont have an inspiration or motivation for doing anything with it. To me it only looks cool on the screen and I like developing it here and there for fun when I have the time and energy.... but I guess thats as far as I wille ever go with it.... since it feels like a great relief when I just quit it... but then again every time I see some tutorial I just feel like I have to learn it.\n\nFor the same reason I felt I have to pass my driving exam. (And in my country a driving school costs like 500$, lasts 2 to 3 months, and driving exams and lessons are extra. Most of us are passing the theory from the first attempt but driving on on actual roads, practicing and doing exams in the rush hour takes at least 5 to 6 attempts for most people to pass... And only 20% pass. I needed a small fortune, 5 years and 13 attempts to barely pass it. Probably because almost every time I came sleepy to an exam after a night shift... and the day I passed it I came well rested... and then I was waiting a long time for the instructor and I had a time to calm down... and I didnt expect to pass it.. I just took it as a joke and didnt really expect anything..... Until... I stopped the car, the examiner behind me gave me the paper with a signature that I passed.... saying \"Here, take it, you passed.. but you know full well how terrible is your driving.\" .. Al that just so I could have it.... not really to use it.. but more for self confidence. Since Im very scared of driving a car. Not only in Croatia where Im coming from.. where everyone takes good care of other drivers.... but even more here in Netherlands where autistic Dutch and drunk Polish are speeding like crazy, and constantly killing cyclists and being chased by police interceptors.\n\nAnyway... I digress... I guess.. I was really looking for an answer for..... well..... why should I even bother learning to code ? Since I have difficultiers remembering the syntax, I dont see my self using it professionally.

Okay, so we sort by the first element and the sorted result looks like this: [ ( \"a\", 10  ), ( \"b\":  1 ), ( \"b\", 22 ) ].\n\nOkay, and now we get to:  5:35:37 where we want to sort the list of tuples by the second element instead (and by a descending order). So, I would imagine the final result to look like this:\n\n [ ( \"c\", 22  ), ( \"a\",  10 ), ( \"b\", 1 ) ] but instead we end up with  [ ( 22, \"c\" ), ( 10,  \"a\" ), (1,  \"b\") ] where the things are now flipped on their head.\n\nAm I looking too deep into this? Or am I missing a point? If I am simply asked to sort something based on a particular parameter, why would I flip things around?

Its been 2 days since I started the course. Maybe 3. Depends how you count them.\n\nIn these 2-3 days:\n\n1. I made my own betting game where you bet on a dice rolling by choosing a number of your choice. Computer rolls a dice and shows you the number on its surface. You win money if you win your bet (i.e. the number you  chose is equal to the number on the face of the dice) or loose money if you loose your bet. This program continues to run and ask for more bets until the user chooses to exit. Today I updated the program so that it starts with a set amount of money in a users account (using a username variable). Then he can choose to bet any amount from that set amount of money. If he wins, his bet amount is doubled and added back to his total amount. If he looses, his bet amount is deducted from his total amount. If he keeps loosing and his total amount hits 0, a message pops up saying \u2018you have no more money to bet. Please run the program again under a different username to get free coins to play the game again.\u2019 Of course, when you exit and run the program again, even if you use the same username you used last time, your account starts with a full balance. I will fix this soon so that different users can have different balances. Even after exiting the program, when they restart, their balances are the same as when they exit. I just don\u2019t know how to do this yet because I\u2019m only 3 hours and 30 something minutes in the video. (This all only happens in the terminal. There are no graphics or a fancy app. I don\u2019t know how to do that yet because this is my first course in python and I\u2019m not at that point in the course yet (if that point even exists in this course). I made this using while loops, and if else statements.\n2. I made a calculator that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, percentage multiplication (eg. 30x80% = 24), squares, cubes, and square roots. The key thing is, it doesn\u2019t exit unless the user wants. Meaning, you can do infinite operations. Say you wanted to do 6+7*8+sqr89-34%*56+sq34 or if you wanted to do a simple one like 4*5+6, you could do both. I made this entire code using while loops, a math function which is only imported when user wants to square root a number (The formula for square root without a math function is quit complicated and I don\u2019t yet know how to make it work in python), try and except function for % and else statements for exit whenever the user wants.\n3. I made a program that tells you what day of the week it was for any date you choose. I did this using if else. I was practicing if else. So i wrote 200+ lines of if else to tell accurately what day it was for any date from year 1900 to year 2019. I created a updated version just after finishing the one mentioned above. This new version only has about 100 lines of code and it tells you any day for any date from year 1700 to year 2399.\n4. I also made a lot of less impressive things like a 10 questions quiz that counts your total score and ranks you as grade A, B, C, D, or F based on your score out of 10. I\u2019m thinking of adding a betting function in it just to make it more interesting. I also want to add a time limit for a question to be answer, else the answer is considered wrong and the score for that question is counted as 0. However, I don\u2019t know how to add time limits yet.\n\nSo My point is, this course is really wonderful. I\u2019m just in about 3 and a half hour and I could do so much. Not saying m smart or anything. M just a average guy. But this Dr. Trucker teaches so well. I hope everyone is making amazing stuff. If you wish to study codes together, you can also comment below and maybe we can study python together. I\u2019ve coded for over 12-14 hours daily that is why I could make this much in 2-3 days.

I know I can convert all the form data into excel sheets already but that exports it as a new excel sheet each time. Also, it does not align different form sections under different custom tabs. I basically have to do manual work. Wanna create a program that can take every new form entry and put the desired form sections under desired tabs. Then I also have this recorded message on my phone to remind people it\u2019s time for the class. Right now, I have to manually call everyone. So basically I\u2019m not using that message.

My mom would certainly not understand it, and I remember from school quite a few people who had a problem in math understanding that when you have x in an equation and you have x somewhere else with a value, you can exchange the x in the equation with the value of x. The tutorial had in my opinion the same fault that I see in many approaches, and really good approaches.\nAfter a while the instructor feels that he has done enough of the slow introduction and puts in words that they are familiar with but the audience is not.\nI am pretty sure when looking at the word counting program, my mom would ask \"what's a histogram\", and instead of forgetting about it because it is not important atm she would give up because she couldn't understand everything and then would conclude that she doesn't understand anything. \nFor instance your introduction of the vonNeumann-computer started off quite comprehensive, but if I were my mom, you would have lost me between memory and hard drive. In your place I would have probably said something like \n\n\"The CPU is not as fast in reading instructions as you are in providing them so you put the instructions into a bowl called main memory where the CPU can take them from later when it has the time. But when you turn off the computer because you don't want to bother with computers today anymore, the computer is cleaning the dishes and the stuff in your bowl gets thrown away. So if you want to use it again when you turn on the computer next time, then you have to store it in some preserving jar which in case of the computer is called hard drive.\"\n\n I watched the video for quite some time, and for instance after installing python, you said that you like to use the command line without telling what a command line is and why we need it at all. Again my mom would be overwhelmed with questions in her head and shut down.\n\nI really liked the video, for me as a computer scientist it seemed quite easy to understand, on a level that I would assume everybody could understand if it weren't for my experience that people not affine to computers have much more basic problems in understanding than I would imagine.\n\nSo to conclude, your approach is a very good one, you put in a lot of patience and the level of assumption of prior knowledge of the audience was quite low, but I am not confident that everybody could understand it.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "stephen chinedu ossai", "text": "Many thanks boss, you have made me  great through this video..please expecting more lecture/video", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Francis Poku", "text": "You will not die,God bless u for helping the needy,you have left a free legacy for generations to come\nMay God keep your life for you to continue to help others", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Keny Leonardo Urgel Yoshiie", "text": "why 13 hours OMG is too much", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rohar Baconmoo", "text": "Woah he\u2019s a biker woah he\u2019s a coder woah why am I here", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Frederick Villaluna", "text": "Cool!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "veganath", "text": "Isn't this the tattooed biker guy that had his boots, clothes and motorcycle stolen by some butt naked cyborg, now he's looking for revenge by learning to reprogram it.
