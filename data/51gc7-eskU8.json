I am using an object which is made up of key-value pairs. Each key has to be unique so I am using that to count the occurrence of each letter by letting the letter be the key and the value being the total count of occurances. The first time I come across a letter, I put it in the object with the letter as the key and the value of 1. If I find that letter again, they key will exist in the object so I just increment the value by one. By the end I have each letter and the total number of occurrences.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Zak Jacobson", "text": "B R - she's counting the occurences of each letter in a string.

So, .split(), is on the string which is a String method (returns an Array object, I think) and then she proceeds to .reverse(), which is an Array method and then .join()!
