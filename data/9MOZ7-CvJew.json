Are you interested in seeing how Kubernetes stands up to the record-breaking viewership and a login rate that is beyond belief on Game of Thrones Season 7 premiere? Come and see things we have done for the Game of Thrones preparation. We will talk about how we provision Kubernetes clusters on AWS, and how we monitor them and microservices that are running on the clusters.\n\nIn this talk, we will also go over how HBO Go went from deploying and running microservices on virtual machines in AWS EC2 to running the very same services inside the Kubernetes clusters. We were able to dramatically increase the productivity of our engineering teams and efficiency of resource utilization in the process. It wasn\u2019t always a smooth ride and it wasn\u2019t a one shot deal. Instead, it was a long and at times challenging journey starting from operating a reliable, production-ready Kubernetes cluster in AWS, advancing to gradually deploying select services into Kubernetes clusters, load testing them, and running them in parallel to our current EC2 installations, and finally going live. Come and learn some helpful tips and mistakes we made along the way, which could help your organization embrace the Kubernetes world.\n\nTalk given by Zihao Yu & Illya Chekrygin at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation 2017 conference.\n\n--\n\nThis talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
