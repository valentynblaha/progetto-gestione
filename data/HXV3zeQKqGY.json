I observe something at 32:00:00 upward when you are explaining about foreign key you said the foreign key; 'mgr_id' that is attached to branch table is showing the relationship that you can refer back to employee table and grab the detail of the manager, like the one you said, Michel Scott is the manager of Scadanta because of the mgr_id which is 101. But i think it shouldn't have to be like that, meaning the mgr_id should be referred to different manager table which may contain the details of the manager not to the table of employee. emp_id attribute from employee table is different from mgr_id attribute of branch table and they cannot be connected together to grab information.\nThat's my opinion.\nPlease sir can you clearly me. I'm just learning sql and i guess you know how new students feel so please don't mind me. I'm asking for the sake of knoeled3.

Sometimes, it's more than two people that share an SSN. Systems that can't tell that more than one person can have the same SSN have created legal issues for people. On top of that, it is possible for a person to have their SSN legally changed. One of the common solutions to having too many people with your SSN, is to have your SSN legally changed. So, it is possible for people outside of Witness Protection to have more than one SSN throughout their lives. Getting your SSN changed creates all sorts of issues for the person that had it changed because it makes it nearly impossible to quickly and easily link them to their degrees, diplomas, and certifications when doing a background search. Not having a background can cause issues when you're trying to get something like a job or a loan.

I do have a question.\nIn the company database, you asked to -- Find all employees born between 1970 and 1975.\n\n1.\nSELECT *\r\nFROM employee\r\nWHERE birth_day >= '1970-01-01' AND birth_day <= '1975-01-01';\n\n2.\nSELECT *\r\nFROM employee\r\nWHERE birth_day BETWEEN '1970-01-01' AND '1975-01-01';\n\n3.\nSELECT *\r\nFROM employee\r\nWHERE birth_day >= 1970-01-01 AND birth_day <= 1975-01-01;\n\n1 and 2 give the same result but 3 gives no result. 1 and 3 almost have the same syntax just that 3 doesn't have quotaion mark(1970-01-01 and 1975-01-01). What is the functon of the quotation mark in this instance?\n\nEdited: Found an answer here \u2014 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36599620/mysql-how-quotes-around-datestring-affects-the-results\n\ud83d\ude42", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw0FDkMwA56Zgfqful4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-04-01T07:41:42Z", "author": "Pratyush Rout", "text": "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzLhVnv64cKRYIb8yl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-04-01T00:30:42Z", "author": "Sanjeev Penupala", "text": "This person summed up half of my DB class in 4 hrs!

I never cascade delete, and almost never delete rows. It's far safer to have an attribute that is something like 'isCurrent' (caption Current?). When that binary is set to false, then you have a query that only pulls current = true, and that is what you normally access, not going to the table directly. That way you don't get in trouble with internal revenue when they're checking your books over, and you don't have any broken links, for example, branchId = 2 in another table when there is no branchId 2 in the branch table.\nWhile deleting rows is a REALLY bad idea, archiving is sometimes a good idea. If your table gets 'too big', you can shift records off to an archived version of the table, and delete the rows from the original table. For example, you may want to do this for sales data that is, say, more than two years old. You still wouldn't delete the sales person, or the product name, etc., but you would archive this sales data, because a) you probably won't be wanting to access it any time soon and b) if you do want to access it you can always restore it to the main table (or merge a query on the archive table), but if you mess with the parent tables (sales person, products) by archiving rows your child table won't know where to go to get the names, and you've lost referential integrity.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzXTSmxl9IyN9jQHVZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-04T07:39:32Z", "author": "Yuhan Perera", "text": "Micheal Scott \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzPyLBAjCm6HeegHw94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-11-04T01:39:15Z", "author": "DG", "text": "Awesome content and really liked the pace at which you were teaching.

I feel more than ready to tackle more advanced stuff and I cannot wait to do so in the next few weeks. I feel ready to apply my new SQL knowledge in my favourite languages and take my game a step further.\n\nI also saw that Mike has lots of other tutorials as well.
