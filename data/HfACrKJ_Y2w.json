I was in a really big motor vehicle accident a few years ago, which left me with TBI and other neurocognitive deficiencies. Before my accident, I loved calculus and I was really good at this. After the accident, it was like my slate was wiped completely clean (regarding mathematics and languages; I lost the ability to speak 4 languages). I have attempted to take integral calculus since my FRESHMAN year in college and I have dropped the course a total of 3 times because I literally could not do it. I didn't know where to begin. I didn't know the extent of the amnesia and it is incredibly devastating and frustrating to look at a subject you used to love and did really well in, and now, I can barely...BARELY remember trig, much less integral calc. But you are truly a godsend, I can't thank you enough.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin's evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\n \nI cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.\n\n\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f'(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.\n\n All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.\n\n Message from the spiritual world of Einstein \n When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on \"universal truth to certainly say to call God\". \n\n Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan\n April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.\n x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021\n World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day\n Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. \n An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea \n The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024\n\n Final note\n The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Personally I don't know where you stand in terms of experience but I expect you are a beginner on account of you saying that you just took a intro to statistics course. Fortunately no matter where you are in terms of experience there is great resources to learn anything from simple algebra to multivariable calculus online. Organic chemistry tutor, Kahn academy, etc. They are all great resources, and there are many more out there. You should use these before going into research, as they will help you to learn new things or even review old things. Math is constantly building upon itself, if there is a weak foundation than it will be much harder to build upon this information. Personally I enjoy math, I see it as almost a puzzle. I can't tell you if you should go through the course or not, but I can tell you what kind of person is needed for math. You need to be able to problem solve rather than just memorized. You need to not be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them. It will be hard sometimes but that makes understanding it more satisfying. If you enjoy math, I think you will like it. Math gets more theory based as you go up. It's your call, but understanding math will help you throughout life even if you don't stick with it after. It teaches you more than just numbers, it teaches you problem solving skills that many lack. I hope this could help. Good luck with your research. \ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 2}, {"id": "Ugw4MrwI_0sgFyAvux54AaABAg.9SIHD5P0rOo9izKXssZTKD", "publishedAt": "2022-11-28T17:22:59Z", "author": "Surya H R", "text": "@The Russian Bullfrog Hi for my research work I need to work on Mathematical modeling, statistical modeling, optimization, regression (linear, non-linear), numerical analyses and what not and I have very less idea about what exactly I should learn to be able to complete my research and where to start.

I am also ignoring the other half of the original fraction where there is no radical). You get  [\u221a(x+4) + 5][\u221a(x+4) - 5] which solves via FOILing to get (\u221a(x+4) * \u221a(x+4) - 5\u221a(x+4) + 5\u221a(x+4) - 25). To simplify step by step: \u221a(x+4) * \u221a(x+4) becomes just (x+4), since you're essentially squaring a square root; the - 5\u221a(x+4)  and + 5\u221a(x+4) cancel out and become 0; so you're left with (x + 4) - 25, which is a much simpler expression. Basically, the conjugate creates the simplest FOILing result and makes everything much cleaner. hope this helps!!! sorry its so messy lol", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwSDFmxaMqOOjWfs6N4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-08-23T17:59:12Z", "author": "Keddrik Yvan A.

I mean one definition of it.. by which it is much popular... So it means u wont get a perfect answer of this division right?.... or 22/7 resolve to some definite real number? And we jus using it as nearby substitute\n\nAnd I think any decimal number is a result of p/q fraction ... its just that for irrational its not falling into set factors (or unit measures) of a line ... no matter how small do we make ... there will always be some offset left behind... So the main question is what factor makes this unsatisfying offset comes into existence in first place... think same as what makes prime a prime or how they get created... I mean something similar but not exactly same problem I guess. :)\n\nSo irrational number sure will fall somewhere in number line space I mean by logical assumption but not in number line I guess that consist of unit measures as integral part of it in its definition no matter how small they are or u make them tends to approach to infinity.... \n\nSame as is infinity ever a number? if it is not then how could irrational number be? ... I mean a real number? \n\nIt will only tends to some real number but will not actually become one... isn't why they call it irrational in first place? \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\n\nNow I know why math is so confusing! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 And they say its only thing which base on clear facts?
