Check out her YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkyLJh6hQS1TlhUZxOMjTFw\n\nThis course combines two courses taught by Dr. Green. She teaches both Calculus 1 and a Calculus 1 Corequisite course, designed to be taken at the same time. In this video, the lectures from the Corquisite course, which review important Algebra and Trigonometry concepts, have been interspersed with the Calculus 1 lectures at the places suggested by Dr. Green.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Prerequisites \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udfa5 Algebra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwCRRUa8yTU\n\ud83c\udfa5 Precalculus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Lecture Notes \u2b50\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udd17 Calculus 1 Corequisite Notes: http://lindagreen.web.unc.edu/files/2020/08/courseNotes_math231L_2020Fall.pdf\n\ud83d\udd17 Calculus 1 Notes: http://lindagreen.web.unc.edu/files/2019/12/courseNotes_m231_2018_S.pdf\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n(0:00:00) [Corequisite] Rational Expressions\n(0:09:40) [Corequisite] Difference Quotient\n(0:18:20) Graphs and Limits\n(0:25:51) When Limits Fail to Exist\n(0:31:28) Limit Laws\n(0:37:07) The Squeeze Theorem\n(0:42:55) Limits using Algebraic Tricks\n(0:56:04) When the Limit of the Denominator is 0\n(1:08:40) [Corequisite] Lines: Graphs and Equations\n(1:17:09) [Corequisite] Rational Functions and Graphs\n(1:30:35) Limits at Infinity and Graphs\n(1:37:31) Limits at Infinity and Algebraic Tricks\n(1:45:34) Continuity at a Point\n(1:53:21) Continuity on Intervals\n(1:59:43) Intermediate Value Theorem\n(2:03:37) [Corequisite] Right Angle Trigonometry\n(2:11:13) [Corequisite] Sine and Cosine of Special Angles\n(2:19:16) [Corequisite] Unit Circle Definition of Sine and Cosine\n(2:24:46) [Corequisite] Properties of Trig Functions\n(2:35:25) [Corequisite] Graphs of Sine and Cosine\n(2:41:57) [Corequisite] Graphs of Sinusoidal Functions\n(2:52:10) [Corequisite] Graphs of Tan, Sec, Cot, Csc\n(3:01:03) [Corequisite] Solving Basic Trig Equations\n(3:08:14) Derivatives and Tangent Lines\n(3:22:55) Computing Derivatives from the Definition\n(3:34:02) Interpreting Derivatives\n(3:42:33) Derivatives as Functions and Graphs of Derivatives\n(3:56:25) Proof that Differentiable Functions are Continuous\n(4:01:09) Power Rule and Other Rules for Derivatives\n(4:07:42) [Corequisite] Trig Identities\n(4:15:14) [Corequisite] Pythagorean Identities\n(4:20:35) [Corequisite] Angle Sum and Difference Formulas\n(4:28:31) [Corequisite] Double Angle Formulas\n(4:36:01) Higher Order Derivatives and Notation\n(4:39:22) Derivative of e^x\n(4:46:52) Proof of the Power Rule and Other Derivative Rules\n(4:56:31) Product Rule and Quotient Rule\n(5:02:09) Proof of Product Rule and Quotient Rule\n(5:10:40) Special Trigonometric Limits\n(5:17:31) [Corequisite] Composition of Functions\n(5:29:54) [Corequisite] Solving Rational Equations\n(5:40:02) Derivatives of Trig Functions\n(5:46:23) Proof of Trigonometric Limits and Derivatives\n(5:54:38) Rectilinear Motion\n(6:11:41) Marginal Cost\n(6:16:51) [Corequisite] Logarithms: Introduction\n(6:25:32) [Corequisite] Log Functions and Their Graphs\n(6:36:17) [Corequisite] Combining Logs and Exponents\n(6:40:55) [Corequisite] Log Rules\n(6:49:27) The Chain Rule\n(6:58:44) More Chain Rule Examples and Justification\n(7:07:43) Justification of the Chain Rule\n(7:10:00) Implicit Differentiation\n(7:20:28) Derivatives of Exponential Functions\n(7:25:38) Derivatives of Log Functions\n(7:29:38) Logarithmic Differentiation\n(7:37:08) [Corequisite] Inverse Functions\n(7:51:22) Inverse Trig Functions\n(8:00:56) Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions\n(8:12:11) Related Rates -

I was completely lost and discouraged, dropped out and proceeded to obtain a degree in an unrelated field. Then my passion for the sciences resurfaced, and I joined a new degree and am about to start with Analysis II.

I was in a really big motor vehicle accident a few years ago, which left me with TBI and other neurocognitive deficiencies. Before my accident, I loved calculus and I was really good at this. After the accident, it was like my slate was wiped completely clean (regarding mathematics and languages; I lost the ability to speak 4 languages). I have attempted to take integral calculus since my FRESHMAN year in college and I have dropped the course a total of 3 times because I literally could not do it. I didn't know where to begin. I didn't know the extent of the amnesia and it is incredibly devastating and frustrating to look at a subject you used to love and did really well in, and now, I can barely...BARELY remember trig, much less integral calc. But you are truly a godsend, I can't thank you enough.

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin's evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\n \nI cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.\n\n\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f'(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.\n\n All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.\n\n Message from the spiritual world of Einstein \n When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on \"universal truth to certainly say to call God\". \n\n Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan\n April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.\n x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021\n World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day\n Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. \n An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea \n The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024\n\n Final note\n The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

What if we have an function that is is defined almost exactly like the example in the video , the only difference being that it is defined in such a way that after 3.01 the graph rapidly increases towards to f(x)=60 until x=3.5 for instance and after that rapidly declining again until x=3.98 after which it resumes the same pattern as in the video.

Personally I don't know where you stand in terms of experience but I expect you are a beginner on account of you saying that you just took a intro to statistics course. Fortunately no matter where you are in terms of experience there is great resources to learn anything from simple algebra to multivariable calculus online. Organic chemistry tutor, Kahn academy, etc. They are all great resources, and there are many more out there. You should use these before going into research, as they will help you to learn new things or even review old things. Math is constantly building upon itself, if there is a weak foundation than it will be much harder to build upon this information. Personally I enjoy math, I see it as almost a puzzle. I can't tell you if you should go through the course or not, but I can tell you what kind of person is needed for math. You need to be able to problem solve rather than just memorized. You need to not be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them. It will be hard sometimes but that makes understanding it more satisfying. If you enjoy math, I think you will like it. Math gets more theory based as you go up. It's your call, but understanding math will help you throughout life even if you don't stick with it after. It teaches you more than just numbers, it teaches you problem solving skills that many lack. I hope this could help.

Why the conjugate", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Rachel Ruddy", "text": "Because multiplying by the conjugate allows you to eliminate the radical. e.g. if you have the expression \u221a(x+4) + 5 (just to pick some random numbers), multiplying by the conjugate [\u221a(x+4) - 5] / [\u221a(x+4) - 5] (basically a special form of multiplying by 1) will help you eliminate that radical as you multiply out (note: I am assuming here, for simplicity's sake, that there is only one radical in this rational expression. I am also ignoring the other half of the original fraction where there is no radical). You get  [\u221a(x+4) + 5][\u221a(x+4) - 5] which solves via FOILing to get (\u221a(x+4) * \u221a(x+4) - 5\u221a(x+4) + 5\u221a(x+4) - 25). To simplify step by step: \u221a(x+4) * \u221a(x+4) becomes just (x+4), since you're essentially squaring a square root; the - 5\u221a(x+4)  and + 5\u221a(x+4) cancel out and become 0; so you're left with (x + 4) - 25, which is a much simpler expression. Basically, the conjugate creates the simplest FOILing result and makes everything much cleaner. hope this helps!!! sorry its so messy lol", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Keddrik Yvan A.

You can skip ahead to the next one.\n6. 7:35:20 - probably obvious, but a little tongue slip here: \"more straightforward to take the log of both sides\" -> \"log\" is supposed to be \"derivative\"\n7. 7:51:40 - the \"thin black line\" looks more gray to me than black. (it's also a wave, and there may have been other instances of a wave being referred to as a line, but that's just me being nitpicky)\n7. 9:05:21 - ALGEBRA mistake: 6c^2 = 26, not 24!\n8. 9:09:09 - This section is in the wrong place (nein nein nein!) This is actually a duplicate of the last section on the course. There's two parts to the Multiple Value Theorem: MVT for functions and MVT for integrals. The one for integrals is later on. If you reach this point in the video, instead of this section, watch the proof of MVT for functions on Dr. Green's channel: https://youtu.be/L2W-CyRYBB0\n9. 11:36:07 - 3/2 not 1/2\n\nJust a few nitpicks for a great course.\u00a0Kudos\u00a0to\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Linda\u00a0Green, and I hope this helps someone.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Benjamin plytas", "text": "at 1:23:30 i think there might be a mistake made. i could be wrong. but please edit it. its not super important, but if someone is already struggling to understand it could make there brains hurt", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u4e94\u90ce\u771f\u5cf6", "text": "I want to make love to this video, I learned so much here than in my school", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Zeq", "text": "Lesss go watching this before my summers semester next week \ud83d\ude14 cs gang \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffd", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Shaillina Rai", "text": "Question : at which level do we use this?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Likita Devi", "text": "I don't want to do my assignments and take notes, that's why here. \ud83d\ude36", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nikitha Bostwick", "text": "TIME STAMPS AND EVERYTHING, THIS CHANNEL DESERVES A GRAMMY", "likes": 2665}, "replies": [{"author": "Lev Mikhov", "text": "Two digit iq statement", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Chandrani Chaki", "text": "https://youtu.be/S8-97elM3ho", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Chandrani Chaki", "text": "https://youtu.be/Z67zK4B6cfU \ud83d\ude0a", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Joshy", "text": "Ah yes, my favorite genre of music\n*CALCULUS.*", "likes": 3}, {"author": "gamini kokawalage", "text": "@[F4Z3]M3KH I'd think they already have strategies for out of the box situations cus I imagine those are pretty common in the real world application of calculus.
