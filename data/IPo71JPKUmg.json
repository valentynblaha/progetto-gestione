I enjoy the ease with which one can create a WordPress website, with headers and footers, and the overall theme, but I can't seem to find a coherent and cohesive explanation of how to inject my own code to control the content of each page in a process flow.  Too many videos tend to be hours long sessions of \"do this, do this, do that\"; without providing any cohesive reasoning for why, and I walk away learning nothing.  Not to mention that I simply cannot bear foreign accents beyond the first two or three sentences. I would rather hear a lecture in Hindi than one by an Indian trying to speak English; and I don't comprehend a word of Hindi. Perhaps it makes no sense to use WordPress for interactive websites, but it would be nice to remove the front-end coding from the equation.

The only difficult part of this project for a beginner to understand would maybe be the part where I create the single post type pages, just because I used the free version of Elementor for the video and you can't create a single page type with the free version. Otherwise, the tutorial shows how to setup a local WAMP server, install WordPress, create the design, install the plugins required to recreate exactly what I did, and use them effectively. \n\nEverything I used is free for them to install and try out. On top of that, they don't even need to create the shortcodes or the custom post types...they can just use Elmentor to create the pages. I understand the hate for Elementor or other GUI-based editors for WordPress from an experienced developer, but obviously, if you can create a theme from scratch, you don't need Elementor. I create it from scratch all the time but I thought Elementor would be an easier way for under-experienced developers to get started.\n\nJust FYI, I built the client site that I based this project off of using custom code, but I thought showcasing Elementor for people who may not be able to build the site from scratch would give them a sense of some of the capabilities of something like Elementor + WordPress. I have plenty of tutorials on my channel detailing how to build a Wordpress theme without Elementor, I even have a series for it. \n\nJust because it is not something you like, doesn't mean that other people would dislike it. From the comments and thumbs up, a lot of people appreciate the video. I don't disagree with all of your points but I think you are thinking about this tutorial coming from a background of experience. This video does not show my typical workflow, but I think that some people will appreciate it...even if it is not something I use daily. \n\nJust like with WordPress or PHP or C# or Java or Node or Angular...you either like it or you don't. There are always people that say their way is better but to the individual users, it is all about what helps them the most. If this tutorial doesn't help you, then let it help someone else.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugw7N8iG6LqXUzumiF94AaABAg.9EH9kGn5bAc9EHjahVGU9f", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01T21:31:39Z", "author": "Sam Anderson", "text": "@Mico I agree, and you aren't being mean by pointing out the flaws. Those of us who know HTML/CSS/PHP/JS/WordPress theme development would not build a WordPress website this way. It's one of the most convoluted ways to build a WordPress site I've ever seen. It is not easy for beginners, and it is not great for developers, either. What's the point of this methodology then? People just can't help buying into the illusion that non-savvy clients would somehow figure out how to use Elementor and update the website with it. They won't, and I've dealt with hundreds of them by now. They build crap with it and then cry. Some garbage plugin like Elementor would make a WordPress website heavier and heavier as you put more content on the site.", "likes": 1}, {"id": "Ugw7N8iG6LqXUzumiF94AaABAg.9EH9kGn5bAc9EHSZuSdaaf", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01T18:54:07Z", "author": "Dev Drawer", "text": "@Lemon Squeezer Ah, I get it. I also think I say \"so\" a lot. I have been working on that, but it is hard. I think it is just the way I talk when I am recording because I do it live, so I am thinking about what I am doing, what I need to do next, and how the video is recording. A lot is going on at the same time and causes my brain to lag a bit at times. :) \n\nAs for the typos, we all have typos...not because I am nervous but just really bad at spelling or my fingers don't work as fast as my brain sometimes. I leave them in because if I create an issue with a mistyped word, I want them to see how to fix it. In my other videos, there are parts where I completely blow something up, but I leave it in because I want people to know what to do if they run into the same issue I did.
