But after skipping through the timestamps, i noticed there are a lot of mistakes in this tutorial and the finished product is a mess of plugins that are all over the place. So many plugins for such a simple website is really overkill and makes the whole project look unprofessional and messy. Most, if not all of this could have been done purely by coding it yourself and it would be much cleaner and not much harder to do, also the project size wouldn't be anywhere near 90+MB that the current one is thanks to all the plugins and what not.\nThe title should also be changed to something that includes Elementor, because there is more Elementor in this tutorial than actual PHP. Its not a tutorial for people who want to learn how to code or improve their PHP, because almost everything is made with 3rd party plugins in this video.\nHonestly I would just recommend using Wix or Squarespace at this point rather than doing this...\n\nAnyway, my intention is not to offend anyone, because presenter is noticably nervous during this video, so i hope he also learns something from this tutorial aswell and looking forward to seeing him improve and present again.", "likes": 13}, "replies": [{"author": "Dev Drawer", "text": "@Sam Anderson Hey, thanks for replying.

The only difficult part of this project for a beginner to understand would maybe be the part where I create the single post type pages, just because I used the free version of Elementor for the video and you can't create a single page type with the free version. Otherwise, the tutorial shows how to setup a local WAMP server, install WordPress, create the design, install the plugins required to recreate exactly what I did, and use them effectively. \n\nEverything I used is free for them to install and try out. On top of that, they don't even need to create the shortcodes or the custom post types...they can just use Elmentor to create the pages. I understand the hate for Elementor or other GUI-based editors for WordPress from an experienced developer, but obviously, if you can create a theme from scratch, you don't need Elementor. I create it from scratch all the time but I thought Elementor would be an easier way for under-experienced developers to get started.\n\nJust FYI, I built the client site that I based this project off of using custom code, but I thought showcasing Elementor for people who may not be able to build the site from scratch would give them a sense of some of the capabilities of something like Elementor + WordPress. I have plenty of tutorials on my channel detailing how to build a Wordpress theme without Elementor, I even have a series for it. \n\nJust because it is not something you like, doesn't mean that other people would dislike it. From the comments and thumbs up, a lot of people appreciate the video. I don't disagree with all of your points but I think you are thinking about this tutorial coming from a background of experience. This video does not show my typical workflow, but I think that some people will appreciate it...even if it is not something I use daily. \n\nJust like with WordPress or PHP or C# or Java or Node or Angular...you either like it or you don't. There are always people that say their way is better but to the individual users, it is all about what helps them the most.

Those of us who know HTML/CSS/PHP/JS/WordPress theme development would not build a WordPress website this way. It's one of the most convoluted ways to build a WordPress site I've ever seen. It is not easy for beginners, and it is not great for developers, either. What's the point of this methodology then? People just can't help buying into the illusion that non-savvy clients would somehow figure out how to use Elementor and update the website with it. They won't, and I've dealt with hundreds of them by now. They build crap with it and then cry.
