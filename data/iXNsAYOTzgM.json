I've also used PCA algorithm, and I thought I had failed due to the lack of number of images of each person. And I have tried dlib along with face_recognition libraries (the one that does not generate a model file), and it took so much time for recognizing.\n\nThank you in advance \u263a\ufe0f", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Vinicius M.
