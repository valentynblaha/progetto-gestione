{"video": {"id": "jh86NGG9jdE", "title": "Answering tricky JavaScript interview questions", "description": "We all work in our respective silos when writing JavaScript, be it a framework or library. After a few years working as a Front-end dev, I looked at a list of \"JS interview\" questions and realized that I couldn't answer many of them (at least not well). So I set out on a long, somewhat lonesome journey of JS discovery, and am pleased to share my findings with you, in the form of a talk.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about getting asked random questions meant to trick you up in an interview (you should be appalled), my talk will cover some basic JS subtleties, and hopefully fill in some knowledge gaps w/r/t:\n- Hoisting and variable scope\n- Expressions v. statements\n- Undeclared v. undefined v. null\n- Equality comparisons\n- How to properly walk out if an interviewer asks you to do fizz buzz\n\nThis talk was given at Nodevember 2016 by Russell Anderson.\n\nCheckout the Nodevember channel for more great talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7z0nOE8ITfrGnXJgNzYaEQ\n\nThis talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk. We're just excited to bring more exposure to to it!\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT35M16S", "likes": "1671", "views": "59882"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Guru", "text": "He's a Christian.
