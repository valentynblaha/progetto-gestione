{"video": {"id": "9zUHg7xjIqQ", "title": "Learn Docker - DevOps with Node.js & Express", "description": "Learn the core fundamentals of Docker by building a Node/Express app with a Mongo & Redis database.\n\nWe'll start off by keeping things simple with a single container, and gradually add more complexity to our app by integrating a Mongo container, and then finally adding in a redis database for authentication. \n\nWe'll learn how to do things manually with the cli, then move on to docker compose. We'll focus on the challenges of moving from a development environment to a production environment. \n\nWe'll deploy and Ubuntu VM as our production server, and utilize a container orchestrator like docker swarm to handle rolling updates.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course developed by Sanjeev Thiyagarajan.
