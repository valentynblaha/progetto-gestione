Ever asked yourself why?\n\nIf you've ever seen a webpage that loads the text first, then after a bit loads the formatting and style, you've seen a page that didn't have the links to style and script in the correct places.\n\nThis all has to do with how the browser decides it's loaded enough information to display. There's an event called 'DOMContentLoaded', and once that event happens, whatever is loaded will be displayed.\n\nThe DOM will tell the browser it's ready once the HTML is loaded, and sometimes the CSS and JS hasn't caught up.
