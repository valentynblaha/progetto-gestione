I wonder if you have other tutorials, because there are still some questions I have. For example, could you change this map to another one? Would it be possible? Or, would it be possible to re-center the map based on the character-position? Like, to go further, after the (0, 0) coordinates?

This starting x is where the left edge of the alien will be drawn.  When checking if the aliens hits the edge of the screen, you check against 736 (I think).  So the alien could start beyond this 736, and if that is the case, it moves down and changes direction, but even though it moves in the left direction a small amount, it is still beyond the 736, so it moves down again and turns around to move right again, etc.  You should use randint(0, 736) to initialize the alien x starting position.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwOxTYluT4-vCvOohl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-27T16:31:25Z", "author": "hossumquat", "text": "You made a common beginner mistake that is an excellent learning opportunity to teach about.  I'm talking about fire_bullet().  The mistake is not considering enough what this function's job is.  What exactly should it be doing?  It seems to have two purposes as you are using it, which is to initiate the firing of a single bullet, but also to render the bullet every frame.  It shouldn't be doing both of these things, because every frame, if a bullet is active, we are firing the bullet again every frame, since both purposes are served by this function.  The solution is to separate these two tasks into 2 functions, which is probably obvious if you really think about and understand what the tasks needing to be done are and the purposes of your functions well.  So add a render_bullet() function to handle drawing the bullet every frame, and have fire_bullet() only be called each time the fire key event occurs.  Even though the code works as it is, I still see this as a bug needing fixing, and often times errors like this lead to it breaking as the code evolves because one doesn't have a strong grasp of what the code should be doing.

On the SECOND window, go to click on \"This PC\", then \"Windows (C:)\", then \"Users, then click on the user where the Pycharm game is located, then \"Pycharm Projects\", then Click on what you named this project (If you followed to the word its called \"Space Invaders\"), now you will be in the file where all of the Python and Pycharm files are located for this game.\n\n4.) Restore down (Click the middle button between the \"X\" out and the minimize on the top right) both windows so you can see both the quick access, and the \"Space Invaders\" file.\n\n5.)Drag the PNG you want to use as the icon for your game into the \"Space Invaders\" file.\n\n6.) Check if the PNG is now in your Pycharm files by going onto Pycharm and looking at the project files.\n\n7.) Do as the tutorial says at 14:57 to make that PNG your icon.\n\nPS. To find where you have any file go onto Pycharm, go onto Pycharm, then look at the project folders on the left, then near the name of what you called your project there should be a thing that says something like C:\\User\\name_of_user\\PycharmProjects\\name_of_pycharm_project which is where that project, and the project files are being stored.\n\nI hope you found this Helpful,\n\n- Random Canadian 2712", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzk1Bc4MTzKHDHPaIZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-10-24T14:31:57Z", "author": "Mark", "text": "You know that a tutorials going to be good when u have an indian talking :)", "likes": 509}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugzk1Bc4MTzKHDHPaIZ4AaABAg.9FCCqnlH1oI9QJsLRrl5El", "publishedAt": "2021-07-27T23:43:17Z", "author": "MemeManNeverDies", "text": "as an indian i can confirm that the indian guy's youtube tutorials are always better than the school material", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugzk1Bc4MTzKHDHPaIZ4AaABAg.9FCCqnlH1oI9OjhxCUEz1v", "publishedAt": "2021-06-18T16:49:10Z", "author": "65k dollar hotdog party", "text": "no its actually the opposite, consistently the worst tutorials not teaching anything just droning on showing the bare minimum to copy and paste and hack together something terrible.

It completely the opposite.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwyADvDjKDv8ax3k7h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-05T02:26:04Z", "author": "Nihar Thakkar", "text": "where is the comment key u do at the start??", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx3zWa1svlU6VprIC94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-04T07:46:35Z", "author": "Only Cryptic", "text": "Can you make a vid on how we can make a leaderboard on this game!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyXvhUYnZ6nu20wdgF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-03T18:54:55Z", "author": "headshot", "text": "Can this make a mobile game", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxMp-6a23Vl7EsvyZB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-03T08:40:57Z", "author": "LunaTheGod", "text": "Thanks for this tutorial i liked it and learned alot ^^", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyuUSjO9rlxPsh--cB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-02T16:23:02Z", "author": "Rojad Sorum", "text": "64 bit ufo icon downloads in zip files python does not recognises can't continue with your tutorial\nanybody who faced this help me out", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyuUSjO9rlxPsh--cB4AaABAg.9Brg_nBEx5a9BtLZ_KlYEZ", "publishedAt": "2020-08-03T07:49:07Z", "author": "Rojad Sorum", "text": "Thanks man", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyuUSjO9rlxPsh--cB4AaABAg.9Brg_nBEx5a9BtJjfaY74I", "publishedAt": "2020-08-03T07:33:09Z", "author": "Akshar kottuvada", "text": "Unpack it using Winrar, then you can use in python!

If you hold the left or right arrow key down without releasing it, it is not recognized by the engine as a many separate KEYDOWN events, just one.

So the reason we can keep moving in some direction when the key is down is because, when the KEYDOWN event is first registered, playerX_change is set to a constant non zero value that alters the x position of our player indefinitely on each iteration, until this constant is set to 0(releasing the key and the engine recognizes a KEYUP event), which then keeps our player in the same spot when it is added to playerX.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx8stH0ZSHqcL5UDXR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-01-05T00:52:27Z", "author": "Mihnea", "text": "Thank you so much for posting this!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwccuXbsmTiOjKg4gV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-01-04T09:07:39Z", "author": "sachinsrinivas sivaratri", "text": "hey,can anyone clarify i have trouble in installing pygame", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwccuXbsmTiOjKg4gV4AaABAg.93Mb1GMzkIe93MyiVgI3LD", "publishedAt": "2020-01-04T12:34:40Z", "author": "Ahmad Yogi", "text": "or type \"python -m pip install pygame\"", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgwccuXbsmTiOjKg4gV4AaABAg.93Mb1GMzkIe93MqsD15x7i", "publishedAt": "2020-01-04T11:26:05Z", "author": "Navin Prasath", "text": "well just go to command prompt and type 'pip install pygame' without quotes.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyQTbJWdLciQ0PLZ-54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-01-02T18:44:44Z", "author": "Edward Aves", "text": "how do you download the icon?  how do you get it under the venv folder?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwIRETJmNS42XYllMh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-01-01T14:45:53Z", "author": "Bharathikannan Nithyanantham", "text": "Thank you for providing such wonderful course for free.It's so great and well structured.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwrOGOjh_-ltEQvL8F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T08:48:01Z", "author": "Abishkar Pokhrel", "text": "Very much useful for beginners !!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwUKXXkbuJtABYNXvd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-29T14:37:30Z", "author": "Ares", "text": "When i press the right arrow it doesn't event move i changed the code \"if event.type ==pygame.K_d:\" and it still the same (btw the left arrow works perfectly)", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwUKXXkbuJtABYNXvd4AaABAg.937k-z-xXLE93LmrucJwG5", "publishedAt": "2020-01-04T01:31:51Z", "author": "Eli Osei-Tutu", "text": "Check indentation", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwUKXXkbuJtABYNXvd4AaABAg.937k-z-xXLE93AnO42xg7W", "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T19:04:44Z", "author": "Ares", "text": "@Suhail Sallahudin i fixed it thanks but i was writing event.type == pygame.K_RIGHT and the correct one is event.key...", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwUKXXkbuJtABYNXvd4AaABAg.937k-z-xXLE93AVjgR-r_U", "publishedAt": "2019-12-30T16:21:47Z", "author": "Suhail Sallahudin", "text": "Maybe you wrote playerX_change == -0.1 instead of playerX_change = 0.1", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwY-M2SzNn1vGbIl1l4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-27T07:51:27Z", "author": "Debarghyo Sengupta", "text": "Hey !
