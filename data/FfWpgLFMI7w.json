This starting x is where the left edge of the alien will be drawn.  When checking if the aliens hits the edge of the screen, you check against 736 (I think).  So the alien could start beyond this 736, and if that is the case, it moves down and changes direction, but even though it moves in the left direction a small amount, it is still beyond the 736, so it moves down again and turns around to move right again, etc.  You should use randint(0, 736) to initialize the alien x starting position.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "hossumquat", "text": "You made a common beginner mistake that is an excellent learning opportunity to teach about.  I'm talking about fire_bullet().  The mistake is not considering enough what this function's job is.  What exactly should it be doing?  It seems to have two purposes as you are using it, which is to initiate the firing of a single bullet, but also to render the bullet every frame.  It shouldn't be doing both of these things, because every frame, if a bullet is active, we are firing the bullet again every frame, since both purposes are served by this function.  The solution is to separate these two tasks into 2 functions, which is probably obvious if you really think about and understand what the tasks needing to be done are and the purposes of your functions well.  So add a render_bullet() function to handle drawing the bullet every frame, and have fire_bullet() only be called each time the fire key event occurs.  Even though the code works as it is, I still see this as a bug needing fixing, and often times errors like this lead to it breaking as the code evolves because one doesn't have a strong grasp of what the code should be doing.
