I have learn React on my own and recruiters do not seem to appreciate it. Further, at this stage at the big companies, I reach 1-2 rounds behind the final round and then they say they found a more experienced person for the role. Recently I got a rejection from the [COMPANY X] and [COMPANY Y . These both required 5-6 years of industry experience. My application took me to the initial rounds and they seemed interested in gauging my potential - only to find I was not as good as somebody they were looking for.\nNext week I am appearing for a full stack role at [COMPANY Z] but it is clearly out of my league - they are seeking at least 6 years experience in JavaScript. I am pursuing it for interview experience + what if it works out somehow?\nI do not know many people who can refer me. How do I get my first React job [without any industry experience]?\n\nAnswer:\n[See video]\n\nAbout Preethi:\nPreethi Kasireddy is an engineer based in San Francisco. She's an avid learner who taught herself programming and machine learning, and is passionate about understanding things clearly and explaining them to others via blog posts.\n\nShe was previously a front-end & API engineer at Coinbase, a digital currency platform, where she helped architect and rebuild their front-end in React, Mobx and Redux.

I been in and out of web designing for a while but because I had been in and out of different countries or in training when I was in the military. Now that I am retired and don't have a job I would love to start pursing something I dreamed about doing for a long time. What would be the best advise about coding in general, should I be trying to code everyday?", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Keith", "text": "Hello Albert, I'm Keith from france. I can feel your struggle as i have been going through the same phase for years. I found in coding salvation to finally be able to get back on track and follow my dream, wich is to become an engineer. So here are some advice i use every day to get better at coding and anything else. \n\nIt might look daunting at first, but it actually avoid the abysmal and endless search for material and guidance and hours of aimlessly searching for the wrong things, so try to bare with this and you'll succed.\n\nStep 1. First, you need guidance and/or a good overview of your goal. If you have someone close that has the job you would like, this person would be the best starting point. If not, you need to research, based on your goal, the industry you wanna work in and the needs of this industry. For me, i'm going from software engineering to, later on, add electrical engineering (from software to hardware...yeah you guessed it, i wanna build Jarvis and then an iron-man!). so my closest target is \"how to be a software engineer\". \n\nStep 2. I then layed out a plan to become a good \"full stack\" software engineer using my own definition of \"full\" stack. Because full stack is the closest thing to having a good grasp of the maximum of software skills before going to hardware skills. This plan you can write on paper, excel sheets or anything really, you just need to implement it every now and of course be sure to always come back to it each time you progress to refresh your goals or situation. It does not need to be thorough. you can just write the skills you really need or want. \nLike \"front dev = html and css = 3 months / back dev = Javascript + php + symphony2 = 6 months / full stack = add java EE for android and or iOS swift = 2 months\".  \n\nStep 3. Then, research the places to learn online that works best for you, both learning wise and money wise. There are tons of learning platforms now and you can learn anything through tutorials on youtube too. Prices can go from free (freecodecamp.com) to around 300 a month for a full degree with a recognized certification. If you are in usa, you probably have access for free to Lynda.com through your municipal library. Just get a card.\n\nStep 4. Stick to 1~4 of these plateform. sometimes you don't understand well on one, for any reason, then hop on the second platform and maybee you'll have that click. It is important to not get stuck and drive yourself crazy on one particular point. Best way to get unstuck is by having a different point of view for the same thing. If you do understand but feel there is a gap in your ability to use said knowledge, then multiply projects involving said skill.\nFor exemple, i did not understand at all Bootstrap on codeacademy, but it got very clear on codeschool! And as of now, though i finally understand everything about bootstrap, i feel a huge gap when i want to use jquery with it. So i am currently doing lots of side projects to increase usage of jquery and slowly get more efficient using it. This is probably the best way for anyone to progress. Know when there is a lack of clarity on the teacher side and when there is a lack of experience (usage) on your side. \n\nStep 5. The universal learning skill. No gimmicks, no tricks. To learn and progress efficiently, after you have set a goal, is just to cut everything in very tiny bits. doesn't matter the time it takes, little chunks you do everyday will always trump big whole chunks you do once a month. It will also stuck much better in your long term memory and after a while, if you implement it right, it becomes more than a habit, it becomes a game you absolutely need to play to get better and break your own records! \nYou don't need to code every day, you only need to get involved with code every day. That means, if you are lazy today, it's okay, just rest, but take ten to thirty minutes to enjoy a video with this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM \nYou don't need to strugle bro, enjoy coding. \n\nStep 6. When you feel confident enough, give back !  you can write a blog like Preethi, help a project on github or help an association for free...or you can just go to a club or any event involving code near you. It's a great way to make friends, get mentors, networking, have fun with fellow coder, sometimes get free food and at least learn something new or see it through more experienced people's eyes. \n\nThat's it, hope it helps and get you through the day. good luck man and thanks for your service.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Wiktor Tkaczy\u0144ski", "text": "I created open source React app for school project and it helped me a lot to get my first React job.
