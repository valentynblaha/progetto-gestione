This talk will go through some sample security flaws unique to JavaScript\u2019s async nature and surrounding ecosystem. We\u2019ll show live exploits to understand the issues and their impact, explain why they happen and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 how to avoid or fix them.\n\nFilmed at http://js-kongress.de on November 2016 in Munich.\n\nSlides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6k4e4xzozd6axr/JSKongress-Secure-JS.pdf?dl=0\n\nCode on GitHub: https://github.com/frostney/talks/tree/master/files/react-game\n\nThis talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
