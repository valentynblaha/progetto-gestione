It's either game over when the snake eats 1 apple, or else it doesn't give more than 5 apples. The collision function is bonkers as it sometimes counts a collision 2 times, snake.increase_length function is wrong as it messes with the array in the wrong way so it makes the collision function unresponsive after 3 or 4 apples.\nThe teaching style is lacking, as he either mumbles under his nose at times or just isn't capable to coherently explain steps and concepts.
