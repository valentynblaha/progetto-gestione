{"video": {"id": "l8Imtec4ReQ", "title": "Kivy Course - Create Python Games and Mobile Apps", "description": "In this Kivy tutorial, you will learn to create games and applications with Python for every platform (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android).\n\nFirst you will learn how to use the Kivy library. You will create graphical user interfaces with buttons, labels, and images. You will learn how to implement many kinds of layouts to create interfaces that can adapt to every screen size from desktop to mobile.\n\nThen you will create a full game with Kivy and Python. The GALAXY project is a perspective game where you need to keep your spaceship on the track.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course developed by Jonathan Roux.
