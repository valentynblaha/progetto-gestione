You can just ignore my comment if you like.\nThe whole format is something that I think can be a lot better. I don't like ready-made code that someone explains parts of. I think it would be better if the teacher codes along with us, and explains why he/she is doing things the way they do it. \nAnother thing is that the explanations are lacking. I actually didn't get what were you trying to teach. Data science? Streamlit? Or something else entirely? If it is data science, you didn't explain any of the algorithms, or anything like that. If you were trying to teach streamlit, you didn't explain parts of it that you use. Granted it was more explanations than data science, but I don't have any idea about how streamlit pyplot works.\nAnother thing is that I like to code along myself. So I watch the tutorial and code myself along with the tutor. But in this video, I couldn't because half of the code is beneath the app itself.

Here's my answers to your questions:\n1. I haven't made a video about it but Tensorflow can indeed be used with Streamlit. I did made some videos on using Streamlit with Scikit-learn which is shown in this video for building ML classifier for the Iris dataset, Boston housing dataset and Penguins dataset. In a recent video on my channel I show how to build a Scikit-learn web app that will automatically build ML models by just uploading a CSV file. Links to the videos are here:\nhttps://youtu.be/eT3JMZagMnE\nhttps://youtu.be/HT2WHLgYpxY\n2. Yes, an example of this in action is on the website of Streamlit https://www.streamlit.io/\n3. Yes it can, you can call APIs in Python and show it on the frontend (using one of many widgets from Streamlit)\n4. Yes, Heroku can be used to deploy models. But there is a limitation in the size of the container, you might want to check if your model and dependencies will exceed that or not.\nHope this helps \ud83d\ude06", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "sukhesh chow", "text": "Good for weekend\ud83d\ude0e", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"author": "Data Professor", "text": "Awesome!
