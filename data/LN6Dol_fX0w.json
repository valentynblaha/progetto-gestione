We're going to be creating a small application in React that calls the Hacker News API. We'll be looking at React memo, Axios (to make API calls), styled components, and finally we will test our work using React Testing Library.\n\nOnce we have done all this we will run our application through Lighthouse (a browser extension) that allows us to test for accessibility, performance and so much more. We will be making 500+ automated API calls in this application, and I want to show you how to use memo with React so that we can avoid making multiple network calls if we already have the data. \n\n\ud83d\udcbb Code: https://github.com/karlhadwen/newsreader\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Video by Karl Hadwen.
