I didn't really know what I wanted to do after getting my journalism and French degrees. I've been a paralegal for about 5 years  but at each of my firms they have recognized my  tech skills and promoted me to positions  like Excel expert working with VBA and  data analyst working with SQL and database in Access. Part of me would still want to be a lawyer,  but even still I would want to be a legal technologist creating  software  or applications  useful in those businesses. I wouldn't really want to be a practicing lawyer. In the past couple of years, I've been working towards Landing my first web development job. This presentation was really helpful, and thanks for presenting many of the basics that I've overlooked or just haven't been putting into practice. I've already sent this video to my local Meetup in Jackson Mississippi, and hopefully we can present on something like this topic soon. Kudos to the presenter for sharing your story.", "likes": 9}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzELgrddV2kwJk_qu14AaABAg.8oXdQcpjHZM8qdo3OTQhfN", "publishedAt": "2019-01-28T11:28:20Z", "author": "Mumba Jumba", "text": "@abhisek k Go away, spammer!", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgzELgrddV2kwJk_qu14AaABAg.8oXdQcpjHZM8pSsjxNgCsP", "publishedAt": "2018-12-29T23:46:58Z", "author": "John Madsen", "text": "Eliot Sanford I\u2019m sorry you got those worthless degrees.  \nHopefully you can turn your life around.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzELgrddV2kwJk_qu14AaABAg.8oXdQcpjHZM8p-EGcFARWq", "publishedAt": "2018-12-18T11:26:35Z", "author": "abhisek k", "text": "Get powerful web hosting in cheap  price .
