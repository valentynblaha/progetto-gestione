If you haven't heard of them, you should check them out now. I get lots of information from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript \n\nWhen I say documentation, I am talking about information that is provided about the product to its users.  The documentation at MDN isn't necessarily written by the people behind JS. Brendan Eich created JS in 1995, but it's now a community driven project that continues to grow. \n\nAs you continue to learn javascript, jQuery, and pretty much any languages or services for development or programming, documentation is your friend. The faster you get comfortable reading and refrencing documentation, the faster you will grow as a developer.\n\nThese videos aren't going to teach you javascript - you will be introduced to terms and concepts that will be valuable as you continue to practice and learn.", "duration": "PT1M23S", "likes": "260", "views": "23986"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwlc21QxZU9-VluFwB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-23T16:51:24Z", "author": "Dclxvi Clan", "text": "She so amazing", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyydPGtLYj4dQBoPhV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-13T22:22:10Z", "author": "nested", "text": "Thank you \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxKbtLnx3COvBSUDfR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-04-28T18:14:29Z", "author": "Technical atul", "text": "\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d yeah", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzU8M8Cx1nLUAB2k5B4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-02T16:22:49Z", "author": "Shubham Seth", "text": "If you are seeing this video after 2018 and calling it bad , you are foolish , it was really helpful when it came out !!!
