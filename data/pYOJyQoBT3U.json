If we dig deep into the agile way, DoD can be at the Release level or at the User Story level. Release Level I understand will be pretty generic but how will you differentiate User Story DOD and Acceptance Criteria? Well, Acceptance criteria might become subset of User Story DOD, it's little confusing!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgiRtj-A5YGmaHgCoAEC", "publishedAt": "2017-07-10T20:43:35Z", "author": "Chris Gagn\u00e9", "text": "I should note that my statement \"...the acceptance criteria, which are written by the product owner...\" is technically incorrect.
