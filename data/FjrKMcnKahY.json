{"video": {"id": "FjrKMcnKahY", "title": "Android App Development Tutorial for Beginners - Your First App", "description": "Let's build our first Android app - a tip calculator! This video assumes NO prior experience with Android, and by the end you'll have something an app you could publish. We'll cover how to create the user interface with XML, and how to code the logic using the Kotlin programming language. These are the fundamental building blocks of any modern Android app. \n\nWe'll use the ConstraintLayout for the layout and two event listeners for the app logic. After you enter a base amount and a tip percentage, the app will calculate the tip and total for you. We also implement a tip percentage animation and a footer to make our app more unique.\n\n\u27a4 Learn Kotlin in 12 Minutes: https://youtu.be/iYrgWO2oibY\n\u27a4 Learn how to publish your app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMzQ2vM1S6c\n\u27a4 Download this app on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkpandey.tipcalculator\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Follow Rahul on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/rpandey1234\n\ud83d\udd17 Follow Rahul on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rpandey1234\n\ud83d\udd17 Follow Rahul on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpandey1234/\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\n\ud83d\udc7e Wong Voon jinq\n\ud83d\udc7e hexploitation\n\ud83d\udc7e Katia Moran\n\ud83d\udc7e BlckPhantom\n\ud83d\udc7e Nick Raker\n\ud83d\udc7e Otis Morgan\n\ud83d\udc7e DeezMaster\n\ud83d\udc7e AppWrite\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT55M20S", "likes": "4423", "views": "169479"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "BNP Creations Lyrical videos", "text": "why don't you use python instead of kotlin", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Ropafadzo Mugadza", "text": "Python isn't really made or used for app development, and i don't think u can publish an app made with python to the google play store because i know with python you have the GUI which u can use to make apps but as i said, I don't think u can publish it for others to use.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "wfemp _", "text": "For beginners?
