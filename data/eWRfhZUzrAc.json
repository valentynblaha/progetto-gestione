Do not be deceived. (A)Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [a]homosexuals, nor [b]sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nFEAR GOD. Repent of your Sin and have faith in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ forever; for the forgiveness of your sin and for the salvation of your soul. \r\n\r\nThe Lord Jesus Christ can grant us everlasting life; afterlife here on earth without pain, suffering and death. (Revelation 21:4) when we Believe, have faith and love Him with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength (Mark 12:30-31) to the glory of God the father (Philippians 2:10-11)  Do Gods will in your life.

Repent; confess and forsake your sins  and trust in Lord Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and for your eternal salvation. The choice is yours .  \r\n\r\nWe are all sinners and desperately need God\u2019s mercy. (Romans 3:23)\r\n\r\nWe have violated His moral law the Ten Commandments. You shall not lie , you shall not steal , you shall not covet , you shall not kill, you shall not used God\u2019s name in vain such as telling OMG TO express disgust , you shall not commit adultery, you shall have no other God\u2019s before Him.
