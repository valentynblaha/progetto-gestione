These 4 hour tutorials online are very meaty to a beginner. I see great content so far in all of these 4 hour tutorials. The main problem I am having is trying to piece it all together in the way it is presented. So, I end up having to fast forward and rewind. For example, I would rather know how to assign rock, paper, scissors first at 19:25 with explanation of what options means. When you only present rock, the mind wants to know what happened to paper and scissors. \n\nSo, I don't register what is said between 3:30-19:25. I have to bounce back and forth picking up the commands in the order I need to learn them in. The downside to this on Youtube is 1) I can't easily scroll to the parts because the video is so long in duration. If it were chunked into 30 minute videos, the scrolling back and forth would be easier because jumping from one second to the next would be longer and easier to stop at a specific line in code, 2) if you use the 5 second rewind option you keep having to press it a bunch of times, and 3) Youtube will put ads up while you do this. Sometimes these ads erase some of the rewinding you are doing for some reason. \n\nShortening these videos into 30 minute sections would help immensely. With this video it would be 9 parts. The benefit to the creators of these videos is that you can see what people are spending more time on. To the student, we can watch these videos in bite size pieces instead of being overwhelmed. Also, as I have detailed above, we can scroll back and forth easier if the videos are shorter. If possible, could there be a download .pdf option to get the code so we can see what to expect further down the video \"chain\" instead of being spoon fed one command at a time? \n\nThe main problem I think beginners are having is not that we don't understand the commands. We simply don't know how to put together multiple commands to do something productive. So, think of each command like it is a star. You put a bunch of stars together and you get a constellation.  I am suggesting presenting the constellation first, so we can see all the commands upfront, what together they are supposed to accomplish, and then discuss each part one by one.", "likes": 53}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyQCLYNoxXftsWd9EZ4AaABAg.9k6b-ap3Y6p9lXfdlnF2_h", "publishedAt": "2023-01-31T03:52:22Z", "author": "Berd Hugo", "text": "@Marcus W suggestions are fine, not defending the instructor.
