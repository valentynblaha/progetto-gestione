The checking of the winner was a little bit to fast for me. But I think after watching this part some times I will get this, too.\nI tried to replicate this project for learning purposes in vanilla js. But I have a problem rewriting the line 79:\n\n$(this).trigger('mouseenter');\n\nFirst I think I have to listen at the board on the mouseover event instead to test, what child element I hovered over (at line 47): \n\nboard.addEvenetListener('mouseover', function(e) {\n  if(e.target.classList.contains('empty) {\n    // find lastEmptyCell etc.\n  }\n});\n\nThen I think I have to trigger the mouseover event from the child element and let it bubble up to the board (line 79):\n\ne.target.dispatchEvent(new Event('mouseover', { bubble: true });\n\nBut the event listener above does not catch this event. It is only called if i dispatch the event from the board (board.dispatchEvent(new Event('mouseover'))). But then I cannot access the actual cell, that was hovered in the event listener.\n\nHas anyone an idea what I am making wrong?\n\nEDIT:\nI made a quick demo: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pKMzYW?editors=1111\nIf I click on a child, I would expect, that the mouseover event listener gets triggered and logs the child id.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxMNCSF7OyiYtNQNxF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-06-24T02:49:55Z", "author": "Kevin Zhang", "text": "thank you for teaching this practical example ...
