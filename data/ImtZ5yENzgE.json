I\u2019m a noob going inch by inch following your lead to make my project. Thank you. Also subscribed to this and CT.\nBut I have a question (actually 100\u2019s, but one for now): \nYou created the sqlite db (~21:50) using command vim which you said was \u201c\u2026compatible with Windows\u201d. What is that? I tried it and got error. Googled it and only found refs to an IDE/editor VIM. Is it related to that? Another package I have to download (ugh)? Am I right that after all these years Laravel doesn\u2019t include a way to create a database (per many googles searches)?\nSo I created my db (mysql) in phpMyAdmin, but could not get phpstorm to recognize it. I had changed db_name in .env from Laravel to my own db name, didn\u2019t work. Had some other difficulty with my xampp (reinstall), but not sure if that\u2019s even connected. Could you explain relationship of xampp (running) & artisan serve & artisan up commands? I\u2019m not sure which of those make the connection to the database, but it finally worked all of a sudden and I don\u2019t know why.\nThanks much.\nNate", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugym7VcmGa019Q87BMx4AaABAg.93rIIq-ynlq96Ee3KSXUWU", "publishedAt": "2020-03-15T20:34:24Z", "author": "PsY", "text": "@Nathan Granger i am not sure about phpstorm, maybe it has a built in mysql-client or maybe there's some kind of addon for it, i always use visual studio code as i don't have the monthly money for php storm and it's a veeery nice environment to build up code, actually i think they're quite similar. but phpmyadmin or cpanel (for leased servers/shared hostings) are my tools for creating a new db or commandline/shell of course.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugym7VcmGa019Q87BMx4AaABAg.93rIIq-ynlq95Q0yOymT8i", "publishedAt": "2020-02-24T10:03:33Z", "author": "Nathan Granger", "text": "@PsY Thanks for the response.

He is not using mysql! He is using sqlite which is different and based on a file. he creates this file with vim. The file is an empty text file with an *.sqlite extension i believe. this is the fastest way to set up a dev db environment but i still always use mysql right from the start.\n\n2. if u got mysql and phpmyadmin installed you can create databases via phpmyadmin, this is probably the fastest way. There are also database clients that you could use and connect to your database (e.g. heidisql or mysql workbench). Then there's a way to create databases via command line if mysql is installed. you can create text files and put sql query code in of course (*.sql files) and then import that into the database that's also possible. but phpmyadmin is fastest way, takes only name and then a button click and u got ur database :) then you configure your laravels \".env\" file in the root directory and enter the db info there of the empty db u created. next step is in console \"php artisan make:migration Migration_Name\" inside the laravel root directory. this creates a migration file under \"/database/migrations/\" that you have to edit. In there you define the table  layouts (mainly the columns you want) and yes, these are php text files as well. There's one migration file per table. check out the docs ;) this course did discuss those steps I believe :) after having set up the migration file you can let laravel write the changes into the database by calling \"php artisan migrate\" in command line.  Maybe it's best to watch the very beginning of this course again. there's also another in-depth laravel 6 beginner course here on youtube which is as good and clean as this one. it's broken down into several chapters, both courses also follow all design principles you should be using urself ;) good luck!", "likes": 1}, {"id": "Ugym7VcmGa019Q87BMx4AaABAg.93rIIq-ynlq94owNijUtSk", "publishedAt": "2020-02-09T15:03:35Z", "author": "Nathan Granger", "text": "@PsY Thanks, but I can't create a mysql db from the editor, right?

Then I needed to install Node.js. Then Laravel through Composer. Composer was automatically added to my path somehow.\nIt was a long journey just to understand how to do this and get it done. \nThen, the IDE. The one used in the video is PHPStorm which  is not free. And I don't wanna use a free version of something I wont buy.  So I researched a little and I went not with an IDE, but with NOTEPAD++. Then I had to figure out how to open the project folder in Notepad++, which turns out to be just dropping the folder in there.\nAt this point, more than 3 hours has passed and I didn't even started making the app yet. But I was still confident to keep going cause I had a job interview two days later and I needed to show something, this app would be one of this somethings.\nProblems are not over. When I run \" php artisan \" it doesn't work, I get an error saying that the file \" /vendor/autoload.php \" doesn't exist. I lost some hour searching about this, till I resolve to uninstall composer and install again through the command line (previously I had done that through the installer). But I didn't did that because I found the command \" composer update --no-scripts \" which resolved the problem by re-installing Composer and libraries (at least that is what I think it did). PROBLEM SOLVED! Phew... I almost felt like an orgasm when I resolved this because I though I would not. :)\nSoon another problem arrived. 500 Server Error when I visit the page. I read that the problem could be either on the .htaccess or the index.php or on permissions. I read that I can create a new test.php file at the Public folder of Laravel with the content ' echo \"Hello Word\" ' for example an see if I can read it; if I can, the problem would not be in .htaccess file. And also that for the same purpose I could check if the permissions are 755 for index.php. I also read that it could be external connections being all attempted at the same time, making them time out. And that removing this external connections could solve the \"500 server error\" problem. I changed a little the .thaccess by commenting out RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,R=301] as I read somewhere and yet it didn't worked.\nFollowing the same problem, I also read that I could fix the 500 Server Error by \" increase the values of FastCGI configurations which located in file \"/etc/httpd/conf.d/fcgid.conf\" \" - I don't even have a /etc folder in my project, so I didn't followed that tip.\nTurns out that this tutorial didn't help much and I couldn't follow it, after lots of hours of struggle with Laravel. Why does it need to be so complicated? I'll find another tutorial that may guide me better. I need a Laravel app done for tomorrow!

I don't know if it's because I was impressed with Laravel's functionality, or the instructor's delivery. Maybe a combo of both. Everything worked, and everything was clear and concise. It was jam-packed with information, and took me 3 days to get through, and will probably take me another month to fully understand, but, as a tutorial, I was able to understand and follow everything being said and my results matched the instructors. Many real world issues were touched on. The only issues I had on my end was the new auth() functionality, which someone else mentioned. Additionally, I was not using PHPStorm, so, in a couple of places use paths were added within the tutorial that were not automatically added in mine - However, since everything else was so concise, I was able to debug without much issue. All in all, an exceptional beginning course. Five stars.
