When it's close it's huge.\r\n\r\nI believe the issue here is,\r\nThe transition means all css properties changing in the specified duration.\r\n\r\nIn this example, initially, there's no transform at all. But later on, on hover, transform perspective() is set to 1200px which was nothing or 0 before.\r\n\r\nHence the transition starts from perspective(0px) [the closest] and zooms out to the specified value 1200px\r\n\r\nTo fix this, in the main style itself, set the transform to perspective(1200px), and then there won't be any animation on the perspective.\r\n\r\nYou can set the initial perspective to a closer number (eg 1100px or 1300px) to get a zoom in/out effect.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "KingXilar", "text": "It is easy to understand you.
