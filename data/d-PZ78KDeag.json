I'm currently studying both PHP+MySQL along with JS+JQuery and while my syntax is always perfect, the logic is sometimes incorrect.  The code is always doing something, just not always what I intend it to do!   I checked out some programming theory books from the library but all the examples with the symbols just confused me more!  \nAfter watching both of your logic videos, I am now able to clearly comprehend what the theory books are meaning and making much needed additions & corrections to my logic.  Finally, my code is starting to respond in the ways I desire!
