The issue I had was trying to add and size the list. I'm really not sure how his code was working, but coming from a C# background, when you use lists you usually need to initialize them first. So where I declared \"List<Location> savedLocations\" in the MainActivity file, I changed this to \"List<Location> savedLocations = new ArrayList<>();\". This simply declares the variable as an empty list, this concept is used in C# also, hence why I noticed it.
