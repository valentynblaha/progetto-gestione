Communicate and document during the whole project. Communicate by documentation too.\nI can not stress this enough. Even if time is very limited, document, hand drawings filed for later access can make a big difference. Take cell phone pictures and save those.\n2. Understand stakeholders, gather requirements, negotiate minimization's. Review with stakeholders.\nStakeholders may include customers, users, service technicians, engineers, and company management.\n\n3. Write an architecture, high level designs, interface designs, functionality and algorithm designs for users and systems. Review with stakeholders.\n4. Write detail designs, may be comments in code.\nDesign of all kinds is a huge topic.\n5. Code, unit-tests, integration-tests, structured programming, modular programming, OOP, state machines, many other techniques\nWriting good code is another huge separate topic.\n6. Write test plans, perform system tests, and create test reports.\nUnderstand as much of the system as time allows. Be a user at a minimum, and a troubleshooter if you can.\n7.

DIGITAL MONEY? GOOGLE? DO THEY BOUGHT EVERYTHING ? WHO'S MAKING NOW \"THE BOSTON DYNAMICS\" robotics in order to control the human population ?  do every companies controlled by that foolish group \"illuminati's\"?? \n\ni try to make reverse their chances.. what i need to do is stand against them! only possible if i have access to the robot where i can reverse it to them.. only way to do that is by controlling it's hardware, or create a fake or clone of that robot.. in order to control hardware, we need to do software.. \n\nthat's how i changed to my look for programming.. and here i am.. i've learnt here from the scratch the C, c++, java, javaScript, PHP, Python, everything by Mike Dane, and i've took few courses from Udemy, Udacity (just the Free course), lynda.com/linkedin learning mostly from \"freetutorials.us\" \n\ni wouldn't say only freeCodeCamp changed my life, everything all source of internet changed me to stand against and fight against the illuminati as a single new age warrior!\n\nonly way the human exists if we stop marketing, and stop the force of illuminati.. we should create our own products for us, we should live the barter system, as practiced in early days.. i have many background and epic background, why i learn to code..\n\nnot only learning just enough code from c to machine learning will makes us a better programmer.. even a tiny details on from assembly language from analytical engine, etc.. will makes us epic guy! \n\nstill cyber security topics are there... \n\nam really sorry! there's a lot to say and cover.. but am busy in learning and mastering myself to enthrall the illuminati group.. be aware guys! if you not code now, your jobs will fly away\n\ni'll give some links to understand who's illuminati from local channel to international channel! it's going to be the #WW3 or anything you'd say like revolution in an evolution..\n\nthus it changed my life thanks to #freeCodeCamp!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUhJTxK5mA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bLhGXtbZDg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iCyHoWGQk8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKx7vyBM1aQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r211u89eUaY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gUrMGnvcfQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z02QfS1TFaE in this video see comments!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d8qiPFMgms this video is in tamil language, but this is true, these 10 companies are taking control of us! we 100% must avoid getting these product\n\nthe reason why do electric car exists in this new era?? in order to control people mind by software!\n\nthe game deus ex - human revolution clearly states that what could be the future of us!\n\nfor example : \"Human augmentation\", \"electric cars\", \"robotic cops\", \"robo army\", doctors in futures be robots, machines will never exists, the robots control the world, there's a deep research going on by \"Talia Gershon\" her youtube video is :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S52rxZG-zi0\n\nshe's ibm research quantum computing head.. there's IBM Watson, there is \"drones\"\nall works on machine learning, learning humans and learning this world, \"deep learning\" and \"neural networks\" watch 3blue1brown youtube channel\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\n\nsee how this works? even the finest details have been recorded.. \n\nsee your smart phone.. there's favorite quote \"if you are not paying for the product, then you are the product\" same as \"Google Photos\" your face have been recognized and your activity have been monitored by google.. if you do anything silly, you'll be terminated in the future.. \n\nthis is how the world runs in future.. so we should stay away from them... in order to protect the human race.. am here to learn coding.. in that way.. this channel helping me alot.. i've consumed more than 80% of all the learning resource from the internet.. am still thirsty and hungry to learn more and to implement it to protect us from the real danger from the future.. \n\njoin hands with me.. and save the world! peace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "likes": 4}, {"author": "Fans of Penguin", "text": "@Thirumalai How did freeCodeCamp change your life precisely? \ud83d\ude0a", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Elescargo red", "text": "im the first viw \nand first like and first comment", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "Elescargo red", "text": "@Thirumalai vasan to you :) ;)", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Thirumalai vasan", "text": "Elescargo red better luck next time \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Thirumalai vasan", "text": "It was awesome \ud83d\udd25", "likes": 5}}]}
