We cover kernel configuration and building, native vs cross compiling, initramfs creation (and other root filesystem options), installing and booting, the init process and system bringup, running an app, adding an example server (sshd), and finally we'll add a native toolchain to compile \"hello world\" on the target.\n\nTalk from Rob Landley, se-instruments.com.
