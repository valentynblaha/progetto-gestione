{"video": {"id": "0oyCUWLL_fU", "title": "Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Full Course from fast.ai and Jeremy Howard", "description": "Practical Deep Learning for Coders is a course from fast.ai designed to give you a complete introduction to deep learning. This course was created to make deep learning accessible to as many people as possible. The only prerequisite for this course is that you know how to code (a year of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed a high school math course.\n\nThis course was developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. Jeremy has been using and teaching machine learning for around 30 years. He is the former president of Kaggle, the world's largest machine learning community. Sylvain Gugger is a researcher who has written 10 math textbooks.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Course website with questionnaires, set-up guide, and more: https://course.fast.ai/\n\nLessons 7 and 8 are in a second video: https://youtu.be/HL7LOfyf6bc\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n(See next section for book & code.)\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:00:00) Lesson 1 - Your first modules\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:22:55) Lesson 2 - Evidence and p values\n\u2328\ufe0f (2:53:59) Lesson 3 - Production and Deployment\n\u2328\ufe0f (5:00:20) Lesson 4 - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) from scratch\n\u2328\ufe0f (7:01:56) Lesson 5 - Data ethics\n\u2328\ufe0f (9:09:46) Lesson 6 - Collaborative filtering\n\u2328\ufe0f (https://youtu.be/HL7LOfyf6bc) Lesson 7 - Tabular data\n\u2328\ufe0f (https://youtu.be/HL7LOfyf6bc) Lesson 8 - Natural language processing\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Book chapters and code on Google Colab \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Full book (or use links below to go directly to a chapter on Google Colab): https://github.com/fastai/fastbook\n\nNB: Chapter 2 contains widgets, which unfortunately are not supported by Colab. Also, in some places we use a file upload button, which is also not supported by Colab. For those sections, either skip them, or use a different platform such as Gradient (Colab is the only platform which doesn't support widgets).\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Intro to Jupyter: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/app_jupyter.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 1, Intro: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 2, Production: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 3, Ethics: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/03_ethics.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 4, MNIST Basics: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/04_mnist_basics.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 5, Pet Breeds: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/05_pet_breeds.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 6, Multi-Category: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/06_multicat.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 7, Sizing and TTA: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/07_sizing_and_tta.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 8, Collab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/08_collab.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 9, Tabular: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/09_tabular.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 10, NLP: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/10_nlp.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 11, Mid-Level API: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/11_midlevel_data.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 12, NLP Deep-Dive: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 13, Convolutions: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/13_convolutions.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 14, Resnet: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/14_resnet.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 15, Arch Details: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/15_arch_details.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 16, Optimizers and Callbacks: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/16_accel_sgd.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 17, Foundations: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/17_foundations.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 18, GradCAM: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/18_CAM.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 19, Learner: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/19_learner.ipynb\n\ud83d\udcbb Chapter 20, conclusion: https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/20_conclusion.ipynb\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT11H12M32S", "likes": "10396", "views": "299622"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwEyvhSRvy4CJ_LPEJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-09-28T20:12:47Z", "author": "Bhavyaa Sharma", "text": "The humidity and temperature study actually proved to be prevalent in real time, predictive statistics at its best.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx8POFVb1J_1cghz9h4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-09-06T17:40:11Z", "author": "Kashaf Khan", "text": "Thank you\nBut what is the eligibility for this course?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugx8POFVb1J_1cghz9h4AaABAg.9fddXFLk7JF9fto8Kb48Ka", "publishedAt": "2022-09-13T00:20:45Z", "author": "\u207a \u2460\u2465\u24ea\u2460\u2468\u2467\u24ea\u2460\u2465\u2460\u2463 WhatsApp ", "text": "Helpline\ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udce5\u2b06\ufe0f\nQuestions can come in\u2b06\ufe0f\u2026.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxhv1Lx3HXQYKRnsoF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-28T07:53:12Z", "author": "Sridharan V", "text": "Subtitles pls, for deaf ppl.
