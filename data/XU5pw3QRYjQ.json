It is people like you who have no understanding of quality content and have 0 idea of things they talk about at times. I am glad you made this comment here and showed the absolute 0 sense of knowing what was being taught.  Just for you  Data science is a \"concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods\" in order to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.[4][5]", "likes": 4}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sai Raghavesh", "text": "will there be part 2 ,please reply", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "SHAGYY", "text": "I would like( and I guess others would too) if you could make how life of data scientist looks, like solving real problems for companies :)", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Stephen", "text": "Data science in my opinion not needed when a programmer at all", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Veera Pallapothu", "text": "Is this a beginner 's course ??", "likes": 12}, "replies": [{"author": "THEDOSAGUY GG", "text": "@devansh verma python yes , math no :*(", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Yash Bansal", "text": "@devansh verma your sub comment get more likes then the base comment \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "likes": 4}, {"author": "devansh verma", "text": "If the beginner knows python and a bit of maths then yes", "likes": 26}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Diksha Nigam", "text": "I've been waiting for one\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Kabir Kohli", "text": "Hey, Thanks for the video.
