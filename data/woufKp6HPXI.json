I myself am a recent hire out of uni and my team's routine is very packed. Not denying that there are other teams with relatively lesser hours spent on productive work. But let me iterate on the fact that she is definitely not the right indication for the kind of work a SWE does at PayPal everyday. Not even close.\n\nAs other commenters have pointed out and we all internally know that such candidates are a clear diversity hire. No one can even bring such things up the management as they will turn on them saying we are being gender biased with our opinions(go figure).\n\nAll these candidates do is get a degree from yet another uni, go online and learn how to do front end design in a week, read some crap about management books, dress up and talk like they know it all, get the job, go give random talks at conferences saying that they are experts in the field. With a bit of search I found that this person is on the design team but there is not even one significant contribution other than random stack overflow copy pastes and what-the-heck conference talks.\n\nI sincerely feel very bad seeing this. PayPal has a lot of amazing people(women and men) doing phenomenal work in the industry.
