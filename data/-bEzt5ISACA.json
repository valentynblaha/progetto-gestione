Nevertheless, I got a few questions:\n1. Example with Pokemon context used setSearch function inside a hook. Isn't it a good way to move such functions outside of a hook, changing its signature to expect dispatch as a parameter? As a benefit of this approach you'd make setSearch treeshakable, and wouldn't ship dead code in case a consumer doesn't even need it.\n2. Regarding the zustand example... Your setAllPokemon function derives new state based on search criteria and a list of pokemons. The question is why do you prefer keep derived state in a store, and call filtering-sorting function two times in a store, instead of inversion the responsibility to filter sort pokemons IF it is needed to the consumer of the store. As far as I understand you could provide a selector for this purpose, aren't you? (i'm not sure since I haven't used zustand and frankly rarely use react). Btw this separation of concerns is what I liked when you showed vatio.\n3. This one is more of a wish than of a question) I would really love to see you explaining the example with simple rxjs state management approach. I guess it would be kinda in a family of atomic state management, but light light weight, isn't it?\nAnd I also wondering about having a good analysis of pros and cons of those state managers compared to each other)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Nas Fong", "text": "What extension are you using?  43:57 console.log(\"ShortedList Render\")  x20 ShortedList Render.\nresult x20 is useful but I didn't see on my window", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Nas Fong", "text": "@Konidoni Ravirr Thank you sir", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Konidoni Ravirr", "text": "turbo console", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sudam Dissanayake", "text": "G.O.A.T", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Arghya Saha", "text": "Thank you sir.

They are passed by value, just like all other kinds of values. The value passed for an object and an array is the reference/address to the object, but it's still passed as a value, and you cannot modify that value. You can modify the fields of an object, and you can push items to an array, but you can't modify the reference to the object itself. You can only overwrite the value with a different value, just like you do with numbers and strings. You can easily test this by trying to implement a `swap<T>(a: T, b: T): void` function.
