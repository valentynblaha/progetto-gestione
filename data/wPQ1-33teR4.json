I appreciate it! I used this tutorial as an example for my cleaning stuffs shop: powders, cleaning fluids etc. But in my work I encountered the very big problem: in my shop I've got three different prices for one product (price depends on the volume of cans: half a liter, one liter and five liters). My first approach to solve the task was to create three addToCart methods: addToCart_0_5, addToCart_1 and addToCart_5. In every item in the storeProducts array I made three prices: price_0_5, price_1 and price_5 and in every addToCart methods I refer to the needed price.  But I don't know what to do with the CART in the state of ProductProvider class? Should I do three CARTS: cart_0_5, cart_1 and cart_5? And if I will do this, how can I work with them in the ProductConsumer? May be my thoughts are wrong and there is another solution? If you have any time could you please help me to find the right way in solving my problem: one product - three prices. Thank you very much.
