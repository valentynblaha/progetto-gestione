True, there are cases where you need to use any but normally in a big project you should not have more than five of them. And if you are checking your project and have like 20 or 50 anys or more this means you are doing something wrong. And you need to really spend some time, think about some errors and get rid of any to make your code really safe and make use of typescript.\" \n\nReminds me of the Michael Jordan meme, \"Do you have 50 any errors in your project? Stop. Get help. Think about the choices in your life....\"\ud83e\udd23\nSo true. \n\nA few projects of mine I had to use any. The issue I had is that my project was using JavaScript libraries that don't have typing. But I wanted to get rid of anys. So when I looked into it I found a few suggestions. \n\nOne was to check if they have a typings library. Another was to let the compiler infer the type. The third one, I realized by accident was that I could set a breakpoint and check the type in the debug console and then provide the type.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwI-SGxI9nTtsPmGOF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-12-11T23:52:28Z", "author": "Luiz Vidal ", "text": "any is my favorite type.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyDe1UM2alM6hVFtZF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-11-17T23:13:13Z", "author": "Vantablack", "text": "I had some issues with the generic interface at 1:20:07.
