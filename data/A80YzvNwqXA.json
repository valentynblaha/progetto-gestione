The code submitted for the N-Queens problem had clear errors in it, i.e. the return statement that would only return the first solution found (instead of collecting all solutions, as the question asks us to do) as well as an incorrect function call in state_to_string (missing 'n' parameter). It seemed this must have failed, the code was fixed and resubmitted, but this was edited out. I don't like that. That's quite sneaky. \n\nBeyond that, like others have said, this video underdelivers in terms of promising more of a strategy-based generic implementational plan. It's just function templates and 30 mins of watching a coding solution instead. The logic for why you only need to discard solutions on the diagonals for the adjacent row in the N-Queens problem and lots of other important details are just not explained.", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"author": "andreisv", "text": "True about the \"state_to_string\", but the return statement exits only one recursive stack call (it is kind of redundant as it would anyway happen due to lack of candidates), all solutions should be still there", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Thrashmetalman", "text": "good leetcode video but doesnt really give a solid foundation on backtracking if the person is a beginner.", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "CalmYourMind", "text": "All I understood from the video is She works at salesforce and she graduated from university of Chicago.

Representing state in a 1 dimensional size array would be the most efficient way to solve the problem since it reduces the search space for the correct positions of the queens by N. However, this is not the only way to store state. You can very well use a 2D array to store both row and columns but that would mean you increase the search space to N^2. To answer your final question, backtracking problems are simply a way of correcting or updating your result and it's done using the function call stack to remember previous choices and then update information. Every solution to a problem has its own unique pattern that one can make use of to solve it. Utilizing an array of size N to represent state is just a pattern specific to this problem. However using backtracking is something more fundamental.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Where", "text": "@Siraj Haq By state she meant the position of the queens in the chessboard. She represented state in her code using a list where each element in the list is a queen; the position/index of each element in the list represents the row that the queen is placed in, and the value of the element is the column the queen is placed in. So, \n[2,0,1,3] would mean the 1st queen is placed in row = 0 column = 2, the 2nd queen is placed in row =1 column = 0 and so on.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "DW Ethiopia", "text": "Recursion is the foundation for backtracking.
