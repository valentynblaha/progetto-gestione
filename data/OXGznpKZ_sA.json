The way I see things, you need to have the a:hover after the a:visited since the last written class is the one that will be applied and have more priority compared to others (since CSS stands for cascading style sheets). So basically look at it this way: if you were to write the hover class first which would be applied to a particular element you have chosen, and then you were to write the visited class, then the visited class will override the hover one since it was written last and is the one thing that will not be overriden. On the opposite, if you were to write the visited class first and then the hover, the hover class will have more priority and will not be overriden since it was written last. If you want a more in depth explanation, check out the LoVe&HAte mnemonic (which stands for the order: a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active).

Sadly none of these videos or articles actually pointed out WHAT NOT TO DO to avoid frustration with CSS CLAMP.\n\nEventually, I figured it out. But this long process wasn't funny to me a single bit, so I took out time to make a very comprehensive video on CSS clamp, demonstrating how to use it to effectively eliminate media queries when declaring font sizes as well as widths. I also point out clearly for you, what you just shouldn't do so you don't spend hours wondering why your CSS clamp isn't working! I just published the video a few days ago.
