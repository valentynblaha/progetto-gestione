Thanks for your input :)", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Angelina Ivanova", "text": "Okay so I hope you understand this, I'll give my best explanation. The way I see things, you need to have the a:hover after the a:visited since the last written class is the one that will be applied and have more priority compared to others (since CSS stands for cascading style sheets). So basically look at it this way: if you were to write the hover class first which would be applied to a particular element you have chosen, and then you were to write the visited class, then the visited class will override the hover one since it was written last and is the one thing that will not be overriden. On the opposite, if you were to write the visited class first and then the hover, the hover class will have more priority and will not be overriden since it was written last. If you want a more in depth explanation, check out the LoVe&HAte mnemonic (which stands for the order: a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active).

For example, the link changes color when it's visited, but that's totally different than the hover state that occurs when the mouse pointer hovers over the link. So I don't get why the a:hover has to be after the a:visited. They're two different states, so why does having a:visited after erase the a:hover state?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Angelina Ivanova", "text": "Do you mean why the a:visited has to be before the a:hover?", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "VISHNU KUMAR", "text": "Excellent  video", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "R D A W O", "text": "Thank you so much for this tutorial!
