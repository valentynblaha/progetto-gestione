The finance minister went bonkers when a citizen tried to pay his taxes with a giant sack of low-valued coins, and decreed that no more than C coins of any one denomination may be used in any one purchase. For instance, if C = 2 and the existing denominations are 1 and 5, it is possible to buy something of value 11 by using two 5s and one 1, or something of value 12 by using two 5s and two 1s, but it is impossible to buy something of value 9 or 17.\r\n\r\nYou cannot directly challenge the finance minister's decree, but you happen to be in charge of the mint, and you can issue new denominations of coin. Being a smart cookie, you want to make it possible for any item of positive value at most V to be purchased under the new rules. (Note that this may not necessarily have been possible before the FM's decree). Moreover, you want to introduce as few new denominations as possible, and your final combined set of pre-existing and new denominations should not have any repeats.\r\n\r\nInput\r\nThe first line consists of three space-separated values C, D and V\r\nThe second line consists of D distinct space-separated values representing the preexisting denominations, in ascending order\r\nOutput\r\nA single value representing the minimum number of new denominations required", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Clayton Blythe", "text": "Really excited for how this can improve developer velocity as well as allow for better testing of Infrastructure as Code.
