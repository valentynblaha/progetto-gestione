We will discuss objects here as they pertain to JS.\n\nArrays are sets of data between [square, brackets]. Data is separated by commas. That data can be in the form of a boolean, string, number, or even another array. We call that a nested array. \n\nObjects are a type of data that can look or behave similar to an array in the way that it's more data stored in one variable in an organized way. You'll hear it referred to as JSON, and when you make API calls to other sites (getting information to display on your own page) it will frequently be returned in JSON. \n\nAn example of object notation is: \nvar obj = {\n\"name\"    :   \"Briana\",\n\"food\"       :   \"cheese\",\n\"dog\" :   \"Maurice\"\n};\n\nNotice the curly brackets, the 'keys' with values like name or food,, and the value called a 'property' that is tied to the 'key', like Briana or cheese. These are ALL stored as strings, although booleans, numbers, and other types of data are also valid.", "duration": "PT1M29S", "likes": "282", "views": "25805"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxF7d3Km6oewmu_1ZB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-16T05:53:18Z", "author": "Anumeha Ayushi", "text": "Loved this simple explanation. \ud83c\udf89 You rock \ud83d\ude00", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyawt6YozLFK0z1vyl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-10-11T16:41:05Z", "author": "Ahmed Nabil", "text": "Json durello", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzUqmCfqcp-8-r9Rb14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-06-28T22:57:32Z", "author": "Cristian Romero", "text": "how beautiful I wanna learn with u", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxd-zgLI-8avMA_B094AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-11T11:17:58Z", "author": "Me", "text": "the keys of the objects arent quoted!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz2og8gwnFBk9M8fxp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-07-31T18:39:55Z", "author": "Vikas Shambhu", "text": "Mam what's ur name iwant more tutorial from u...
