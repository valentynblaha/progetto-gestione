Figuring that stuff out took me a LONG time , even with using stackoverflow.... there just doesn't seem to be a lot of information on it.  So I feel you, i managed to figure it out, but it was difficult as the information for how to do that stuff is pretty scattered.   I made a program that uses pythonocc with PyQt5 to display 3D models in a viewer that also uses Qt's animation methods,.  It also dynamically adds animated buttons depending on what options are picked in the program and also dynamically adds images that double as buttons and it also dynamically draws lines in a graphics scene.

Easy to use, easy to implement.
