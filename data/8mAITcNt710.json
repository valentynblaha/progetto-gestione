How does it know that one of the for loops is horizontal and one is vertical?\n\nMy best guess is the placement of his printf(\"\\n\") as it is outside of the second for loop.

I needed to check another video on nested loops.\n\nBasically, the outer loop runs which causes the inner loop to run X amount of times. (X being the amount the user input). When the inner loop finishes those X number of loops, it moves on to the end of the outer loop which prints a new line and starts another run of the outer loop, which then leads to X amount of inner loops being completed again.\n\nFeels incredibly satisfying to struggle intensely with this fairly basic concept but then come to understand it a couple hours later.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "james mining", "text": "Hey.

I remember after a while I took part in a code golf thread on 4chan's technology board, the topic was text to ASCII code converters and I won by a landslide. Code golf is a game, not development, it's important to remember that. Yet these people were writing neat and very readable code, and that's how you lose :)\n\n\nTheir submissions were all between 15-50 lines. I simply posted:\n\nfor(int x;x=getchar();printf(\"%d \", x)); \n\nThey complained so hard, that it's ugly, that it abuses the language (because they don't understand how it works... I'll explain later), that it didn't compile correctly on their obscure compiler, that I \"incorrectly used the for() loop\", that it doesn't count as a full program because it doesn't include all of the code needed to run it, so I fixed it:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(){for(int x;x=getchar();printf(\"%d \", x)); }\n\nAnd they were somehow even more angry, but even though they tried to deny it, I won the game. It was a very memorable, beautiful moment.\n\nFor all the newbies learning from this video, it's an extremely simple program:\nThe for() loop keeps my program running until you exit.\nI define a variable I called x and assign it to the \"get character\" function in the standard library.\nBy outputting the input as a number, you receive the corresponding ASCII code of that character or string.\n\nAnd that's it, you can type a single character or a full paragraph then hit enter and boom, it display the code(s) and stays running, awaiting more input until you exit. \nIt works flawlessly without a single error in the compiler.
