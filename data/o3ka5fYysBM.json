To start, you should only work with monolithic services as they have a low overhead compared to microservices. There are plenty of resources out there. I would recommend reading through medium.freecodecamp.org, dev.to, codeburst.io, and the various youtube channels including freeCodeCamp. Beau has some great tutorials on this channel as well.

The server-side is client agnostic. You can follow the same server-side pattern for mobile development. As for cloud deployment, my favorite is Now.sh and I would highly recommend it. I've also used AWS & Azure heavily, which seem to be too much of a headache for smaller projects. If you go the AWS route, I'd recommend Elastic Beanstalk instead of directly configuring EC2.
