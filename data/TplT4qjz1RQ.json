And when the data is not modelled correctly structurally, you'll notice that when building the view around it that something is not right - so you go back to the model, change stuff, maybe scrap some ideas entirely, and then go back to the view and change that also... Then the circle continues and you'll go back and forth.\nOn the other hand - if you start with the view (you could use static hard-coded data), you are working more directly on the end result and when that looks fine, you can model the backend according to what it _actually_ needs to do, and nothing more.", "likes": 3}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tajjamal Abbas", "text": "I don't have CS degree but have a will to learn programming \nsuggestions required from experience one guys", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"author": "BahawalTV", "text": "\u200b@Tajjamal Abbas https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-5T8wwCGNa6of0w1IS9hY2_6aUNoCO05", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Tajjamal Abbas", "text": "@BahawalTV please share these", "likes": 0}, {"author": "BahawalTV", "text": "You don't need a CS degree.
