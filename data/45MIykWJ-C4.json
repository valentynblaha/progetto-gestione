I can kind of see what you mean. I do not really explain the C++ code usually because of two reasons:\n\u2022 C++ is not the focus of these tutorials, OpenGL is\n\u2022 I assume you understand C++ code\nBut also I do ocasionally explain the code. As for specific OpenGL functions, sadly I can't do much more than give u the function. How should I explain why I use that function if that function is the only one that does what I need it to do. And the things that I need it to do I do explain. I am fairly confident I always give the Computer Graphics theory behind what we are making. And I think that CG theory is the most important part.\n\nThank you for the feedback though, I will definetly take it into account for future tutorials, not for this tutorial series though, cause I want to keep it pretty consistant.\n\nLet me know if u have any other feedback, I am willing to listen", "likes": 1}, {"id": "Ugxi2Ilj7x7TPxTklc14AaABAg.9Nlfnt0Lxd29NtvIvRQHRz", "publishedAt": "2021-05-28T19:26:53Z", "author": "Music Coder", "text": "yeah I dont think this is a tutorial, more like an explanation of someone's side project.
