They are really helpful.  One questions on using multiple adapters.  Let's say I have two adapter setup in a VM and both have internet access.  How does VM pick which adapter to use when I try to access internet and is this deterministic?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"author": "John B", "text": "In the case of Windows (my assumption to the OS you're using since you called it a \"adapters\" instead of \"network devices\"), Windows will choose the adapter with the lowest routing metric. The determination for routing metric is based off of things such as link speed (a 10 Gb adapter will be chosen before a 1 Gb adapter). If both adapters have the same link speed, then hop count and time delay will be measured to determine which adapter to select as the primary adapter.\n\nIf by some chance both adapters had the same link speed, hop count, and time delay then Windows will select the first discovered adapter (discovered meaning when the system has scanned for any and all network adapters during boot).\n\nIn Linux systems, routing information is usually contained in a file called /etc/network/interfaces which will specify which IP addresses a device has or if it should wait for an address from DHCP. Typically the first network device will be selected to handle the default route. However if the first device loses connectivity, it's not guaranteed the second device will immediately take over. This is where a feature called \"network teaming\" (in Windows) or \"network bonding\" (in Linux) comes into play.\n\nA bond can be set up between two adapters for multiple purposes but a common trend is to set up the bonded devices for failover. You would connect eno1 port to one switch, eno2 to a different switch but in /etc/network/interfaces create a new logical device called \"bond0\" (or something similar). One device will be the primary device while the second one is \"asleep\". The loopback address continuously scans the network devices to see which is up and connected to a responding switch (this is called the \"carrier\"). If the loopback address detects that the primary device has lost its carrier, it will switch this device off and make the secondary device now active. \n\nThe secondary device(s) also must create a virtual MAC address so the MAC address does not change when the primary device is dropped. Otherwise a message sent by the primary device prior to losing connectivity will never get back to the host machine.", "likes": 4}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "karips", "text": "2:10:02 RIP dot", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Yafiz Abraham (TechWorld)", "text": "nice one", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "gopi sabbineni", "text": "I have one question, I am using Jenkins on my windows localhost (not on aws cloud) and I am trying to  integrate aws ec2 instance through publish over ssh pulgin. but error coming like this \"jenkins.plugins.publish_over.BapPublisherException: Failed to connect and initialize SSH connection.
