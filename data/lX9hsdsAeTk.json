The answer to it assuming I've understood what you are asking is NO. The \"parent\" is likely another change made to the codebase prior to the 2 commits that were squashed together - NO only because you might want to keep that change. \n\nIf you were squashing to 2 commits into the \"parent\" in which case, you are really squashing 3 commits together, and you did not really want any of the 3 commits in your code base, you can technically do it. But the better thing to do in that situation is to just delete all 3 commits. You don't need to squash them before you delete them.\n\nIt is quite possible that I've not understood the question because quite frankly the question is a bit short of details. But you can always try things out yourself without messing up your current git branch and that is the wonderful thing about git. Steps:\n/home/<user>/<directory>> git checkout -b temporary-branch\n/home/<user>/<directory>> git rebase -i HEAD~15     // I've chosen 15 arbitrarily. You need to decide how far back the commits should go to get to the commits you need\nPerform the squashes and deletions that you think you need in the file that opens. Save the file and exit.\n/home/<user>/<directory>> git log --pretty-print\nCheck to see if the commit history looks correct to you, and build you code and run it to make sure you haven't deleted some commits that you did not intend to.\n\nGood luck !", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "blasttrash", "text": "awesome tutorial", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "The CS Content", "text": "I also do videos about programming!\ud83d\ude01", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jean Carlos", "text": "Great explanation!\nBoom!

You should have used git status and git log to find information about the commit history. And you also used the GUI tool to checkout different branches, and even do cherry-pick! I'm not necessarily against using GUI tools, but the title of your video is \"How to Undo Mistakes With Git Using the Command Line\r\". It implies that you will not use any GUI tools, only Using the Command Line! If instead you would have used Command Line ONLY and not used the GUI tool, it would have made explaining the actual git commands better. I think that using the GUI tool is less clear about what is actually going on. It is better to use the actual Command Line to explain how git works, especially since that's the title of your video!", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Njul", "text": "Git Tower looks nice, but it's not available for GNU/Linux, so I'll stick with command line.", "likes": 7}, "replies": [{"author": "ILIYA LESANI", "text": "Use GitKraken", "likes": 0}, {"author": "A.
