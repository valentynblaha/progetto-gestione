Literally hitting 0 in my bank account. Just a 23 year old hitting quarter life crisis. Gave music an honest shot. I moved to LA (next to USC) trying to get work and getting into the industry for around 8 months or so. Worked in the audio engineering field and majored in violin performance in CSULB's conservatory. I'd get calls to be a \"runner\" or perform little violin gigs here and there. All the while working in our family's little restaurant in the nice city of Arcadia. Work's not easy. My mom literally damaged her ulnar nerve and her hand can't function properly anymore. I've lost count of how many holidays we've missed, and how many times we had to stay over night and take turns working 20 hour shifts over weeks. Even then, we didn't make much. With rent, utilities, and taxes adding up for a small business we pretty much just evened out the 5 years that we were at May's Cafe.\n\nAt first I was convinced to do web development by a friend who also transitioned from music. He's probably pretty far along that track now. Big shoutout to Matt! Learned some javaScript in July and spent a steady 8 hours a day studying. School wasn't in session so I had the luxury of time on my hands. Family business is so run down anyways, I had so much downtime to follow tutorials on CSX and YouTube. The honest truth came to me and I found that many devs nowadays are struggling too. Sure there's a lot of YouTube success stories, but just looking at Indeed's job search. There'd be over 100-200 applicants for web dev job openings that are posted within the hour. Many of them requiring really high standards in degrees and certifications, and who knows how many of those hoards of applicants even made it into the interview.\n\nComing from a music background, everything tech seemed to intimidating to me. I reluctantly chose cyber security after my friend told me about the OSCP cert. He said he'd help me get connections if I get good enough, but pass the OSCP first. A certification that can drastically increase your chances of getting a job? I chased after it. And yes I know, I seemed so shallow just chasing it for monetary reasons. To be fair, I still had like only $2 in my bank account. I was desperate, and no, a minimum wage job would not support the minimum $3k that I had contracted myself to that I had to pay monthly for the family restaurant. COVID loans have all been depleted as well.\n\nI didn't like cyber security at first. Professor Messer's security+ videos was just full of terms that I didn't understand, and it was just so dry. Then I stumbled onto this video, and I was surprised that I was able to follow along. Sure I had to rewatch some stuff, or Google things whenever network things came up. Getting stuck on Python with no one around to help and having to redo the exercise 10 or 20 times just for everything to burn into my memory was fun. Have I mentioned that school started again for me? Yeah getting a music degree at this point is probably very pointless, but I have no regrets for all the fun people and experiences that I've made. It does take up so much time though. I'm typing this literally coming after a 5 production session; into a 3 hour delivery for the Cafe; going to Barnes & Noble to study (this course); coming back to the restaurant to eat while finishing this course. I just finished the video. Seeing the \"fin\" at the end almost made me cry. That last lab was hard for me (I'll probably do it a couple more times), and I can hopefully celebrate it with a sandwich or something someday.\n\nCyber security for sure grew on me. An old high school friend (who works professionally on the blue team) recommended Darknet Diaries to me, and I now realized the scale and enormity of cyber warfare. It's fun, though a lot of these exploits have already been patched in a short 3 years, I enjoy the new challenges I face daily, whether it be on HTB or TryHackMe. Hopefully I'd get good enough by the time I finish my music degree and can get my first attempt at OSCP soon after. But for now, 14 hour work/school days is really taking a toll on me. It's a world that I can't wait to begin exploring though.\n\nAnyways, whenever I feel down or sad or something I'd probably come back to this video. Since I spent so much time redoing all the exercises around the practice rooms and gym at school. Around libraries and local Barnes & Nobles that I'd pass by. Or even at home. TCM's guides are literally my foundation to what I'll do moving forward. I'm so blessed to have the support of my friends and family. Hoping that seeing this message in the future would motivate myself even just a little.\n\nGood luck Ed, you got this!", "likes": 21}, "replies": [{"author": "Nabil Ahmed", "text": "This motivated me to finish this thank you for taking time to write this", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Edward Pan", "text": "@uncle joe  yes yes, I'm glad I have someone who's walking a similar path as me out on the webs.

     \n[name] = [data] - This type of declaration will automatically set the type of the variable     \n[name] int([data]) - This type of declaration will set the var type to int      \n[name] float([data]) - This type of declaration will set the var type to float. \n[name] str([data]) - type of declaration will set the var type to String.      \nTo convert a variable to a different type you can just use [type]([data])\noutput: 29 // the print command can only print strings      \ntype(data) - return the type of variable the data / variable entered is     \nInt variables does not round up or down they just use the first whole number available for example - 29.8 -> 29.     \n\nFunctions:\n\ndef [name of the function] ([function input variable]): - defining a function      \nreturn [var or operation or some kind of value resulting code] - return gives the information back to the program after the function has ended.     \nwhen defining a function input (A parameter) you use the name of the variable inside the function to access that value. \nYou can add multiple parameters into a function.     \n\nBoolean Expressions:      \n\nTrue expressions:         \nbool1 = True     \nbool2 = 3*3 == 9     \n\n False expressions:         \n\nbool3 = False\nbool4 = 3*3 != 9\n\nRelational and Logical operators:      \n\nRelational:         \n> - greater then         \n< - less then         \n>= - greater then equal to         \n<= - less then equal to\n== - equal to \n\nLogical: \n\nand - both statements have to be true         \nor - one of operators have to be true (or both true)         \nnot - Inverts the boolean value     \n\nConditional Statements: \n\n if [Condition]: - check if the Condition is true and if yes executes the code below     \n else - executes the code below if the statement of the if is not true     \n elif - can come between an if and an else statement as another condition to check if the if is not true      \n\nThere are no switch statements in python! \n\nLists:     \n\n[name of the list] = [[value1], [value 2] , [value 3[ ....]     \n[name of the list].append([data]) - will add the data to the end of the list      \n[name of the list].pop() - will remove the last piece of data in the list (or a certain place in the list if given data inside the () of what place to remove)     \nzip([list 1] , [list 2]) - will combine the two lists and save the values in the same place , data 0 of list 1 will be stored with data 0 of list 2 in the following way :      ([data 0] , [data 0]).          \n lists count from 0 - so to print the second value we use [name][1]     \n we can call multiple values by calling out +1 more value then we want. for example to print value 1   and 2 we will use [name][0:2] this will print 0 and 1.     \nwe can print the entire list from a certain point up to (or down to) the entire list by not giving a value. [0: ] or [ :3] this will print all of the list or everything up to the 4th item.     \nnegative items (-1) will pull the last item in the list     \n\nTuples:\n     \nA tuple is like a list but cannot be modified. \nTo make a tuple you need to use () instead of [] in a list      \n\nFor loops:\n\nfor [variable] in [Something with value (can be a list, variable...): - This loop will add 1 to the first variable until it reaches the end of the second variable (print all the list, all the numbers in an int...)     \n\nWhile loop:\n\nwhile [statement]: - this loop will execute as long as the statement is true\n\nWhile python is important to understand, it isn\u2019t required knowledge. A penetration tester can technically know nothing about python and still do a good job. However it is extremely helpful to be able to understand different scripts and even be able to write your own. Knowing a programming language is completely needed for almost every other cybersec field. TL;DR, by the end of the course you should able to write basic scripts, and understand how intermediate to difficult scripts work.\n===", "likes": 2}, {"author": "random dude", "text": "I want it", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Emmanuel Egwurube", "text": "For all hacks text @the_orisas_light ig", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Emmanuel Egwurube", "text": "For all hacks text @the_orisas_light ig", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Kingsley Mario", "text": "If you have any problems with your hacked Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter, telegram, Cashapp, PayPal, bank account etc and you want to get them back I recommend the_mysteriious_hacker on IG he is the best among others", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jill Clinton", "text": "I had City High, What Would You Do, stuck in my head for 10 freaking years!

What you are going to get in your CV after taking this 8 hour course is...your Notes only...\nSo suppose you took the complete course and you are like me...you will go for the job straight! Right!? Well that's all wrong....\nYou may go to freelance website maybe different companies and the first thing you come to know about is...there is CUT THROAT competition people are dying to working for free just to get some experience...of course other people who were same like me (youtube/udemy students) \nSo you figure out you need a strong CV and for that you need good intership experience , so now you go to internshala (or other similar websites) to get an intership.... again the competition problem shows up here ... People are so competitive they have done 3 different courses 5 different courses, and of course they will be selected..why would a company manage 5 interns when its getting 5 employees in one!\nTHAT WAS ME! and I think nearly all of people who start with this FREE! learning attitude endup like this(or learning cheap from udemy- both are quite the same thing) ..comes out the FREE was the most expensive option \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35 \n\nWhat was the solution for me then (or for people like me)....\nSIMPLE...1) drop the FREE attitude ...just for saving 6000-7000 you are talking yourself into unecessary trouble!\n2) *MOST IMPORTANT* CHOOSE an education platform which provides you personal MENTOR attention like college and an intership...so basically find an online college (and yes it is rare as it sounds like)\n\nAfter I realized this it took me some time to find out one such platform. Then I really discovered how helpful a mentor's guidance can be and got a really good intership as they promised and easily got freelance contracts ....much easier then it was before \nSo goodluck on your search , that's what I wanted to convey you and if you have read this far ..... please don't do the mistake i did...", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "XD", "text": "No gracias ay luego", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "ECE 61 SHYAM KUNTAL", "text": "Is this a good one?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "slaughterlol", "text": "I have a question, do I HAVE to learn Python or can I just learn hacking, added with all the necessary stuff with Python in this video?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "One Of Many", "text": "you can learn python and it will help you writing these tools, but the most important thing will be to understand the tools, and when and where to use them.\nweek 2 homework was on codecademy, the free python2 course. that I can recommend for some basic python.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "JS CS", "text": "1:28:00", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Uday Datrak", "text": "Awesome friend.

And it cuts both ways! Stop caring what they think or how they judge you. The audacious ingratitude for not having to suffer learning by trial & error (as we did) will be their \"huberous\" downfall. People around me rarely get it, even when I help pick them up again. I can be just as merciless and judgemental or I can be forgiving and compassionate. We all can. Most prefer the latter. Once I know their MOTIVE (photographic memory-a blessing or a curse) I respond accordingly. You should too, you'd be excellent at it. Just an FYI (staying productive through the boring parts).

Remember, being ethical doesn't mean the actions you take are legal.  \n\nAs far as where to continue, well, that is as far as you wish within whatever limitations restricts you, voluntary or otherwise.  I would recommend pursuing something specific that you are motivated to explore, especially if you can connect that with a specific goal.  Example:  you're interested in Python (general) so you decide to do \"X\" with Python.  Have you mastered Python?  No.  Did you learn something along the way and have fun?  Hopefully.  You've probably deepened your skill/knowledge of something SPECIFIC.  This also works in reverse.  Example:  I want to do \"X\".  Now you learn what's needed to do \"X\".  If successful, you may have BROADENED your knowledge/skills, but not deepened anything specific.\n\nIt's a broad, multidisciplinary field.  Creativity and exploration are at the core of the original meaning (in my opinion) of what it means to be a hacker.  It's a sacred, personal journey but there are folks to help you along the way...or to collaborate with.\n\nBest Regards", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Luca Wawer", "text": "penetration tester...", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Toiobur Rahman", "text": "1:04:47 what is arp-a?
