I put card images in there,  and gave them the illusion of flipping over from back to front when selected. Introduced a dealer so you played against the dealer, and added a whole host of other stuff; different sounds for winning, losing and  when you tied with the dealer and a few other scenarios. Also, word prompts on screen for what play options you had next.   \n\nThe process was full of joys, frustrations, headaches and mini victories; but mainly exciting to work on.. but I learned so much, and had several 'punching the air' glory moments when I got parts of the game to work.  I say this not to boast, but to encourage any of you who are learning JS to push past the pain so you can get that little 'hit' from the reward of solving a problem.  It is REALLY worth it. You'll be so proud of yourself. My code is messy, but I'm figuring out how  to clean it up and make it more efficient and readable; but just the fact that it works, makes me feel deep satisfaction.  \n\nThis  video is going onto my dev playlist so I can learn these games and flesh them out.

With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide. \r\n\r\nProcedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.     \r\nBeing as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a \"gift\" to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call \"paradise\", but once they verify that the element in question doesn't take the bait (because he\u2019s not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.  \r\nAs a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.     \r\nThe second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined. \r\nIn paradise a kind of personal \"circle\" is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it's all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.    \r\nOf all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she's the most beautiful woman in the world.     \r\nTheir way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear.\r\nNot having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.       \r\nOn some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).     \r\nTheir followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves. \r\nDemons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more.\r\nHell consists of 9 levels. \r\nThe souls of people who commit suicide are struck by the eyes little by little until they get their eyes ripped, a process that lasts years and they have to turn 15 turns before they can be saved.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "zZz", "text": "@30:37 \"watch my sort algorithm\", Where can I find this link?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Passive Pulse", "text": "Hot chick teaching nerds how to code.

For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. John 3:16-17\n\nJesus is The Son of God who was sent to the earth from Heaven to die on the Cross to save humans from burning in hell FOREVER. He took the punishment who us who deserve to be punished. So since He died and Rose again, we can now be free from hell and He offers us everlasting life meaning to live FOREVER with Him in Heaven or the New Earth. All we have to do to receive this free Gift is to believe in Jesus, believe in that He died for yours sins and believe that He Resurrected (came back to Life) on the third day. Once you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is LORD you will be saved. (Saved from hell). He is coming soon, tomorrow is not a promise so please dont waste time, put your faith in Jesus while there is still time, so you wont have any regrets. Jesus the Only Way, the Truth, and the Life. Once you have Jesus you have everything you need. You have freedom with Jesus. Besides you can see literally see nearly everything the Bible talks about comes through so why doubt when you can see the Truth unfolding in front of our eyes. If you want to know anything at all regarding Jesus you can ask. God Loves you, Jesus Loves you.\n\nhttps://t.co/Z3z5QmW3PE\n\nJesus has changed my life, He answered my prayers, i had been praying for years so I can get baptized and He answered that prayer when the time was right. Both my parent use to drink alot and plus my dad use to smoke cigarettes and I use to suffer because of that my dad has also fall away from his faith at that time but Jesus sent one of His followers to my dads work and then he use to talk to my dad about His life back together with Jesus to build a relationship with Him and that same year around Christmas a bit after my dad got sick and the follower of Jesus prayed for my dad to get better and he did, but while he was sick he did not smoke or drink and even after that he never drink or smoke again Jesus has freed him from that trap which he was in since he was a teenager. My dad has built his relationship with Jesus and now is free of his past and lives for Jesus. After I got baptized I still was not close enough to Jesus but after a few months the Holy Spirit who is living inside me found a way to make me take my relationship with Jesus and I did. Later on I had my final exams and I barely studied, i told Jesus that He is my priority and it my grades doesnt matter however I had faith in that i would pass because of Jesus and when I got result o saw He did not let me down and I pass all my subjects only because of Him. A time I was praying for a job and the week after in church a opportunity came by. I also applied online for jobs and ask my uncle for help in finding one and one day i kneeled down and prayed and within a few minutes to an hour i got a call from my uncle saying he got me an interview and later that day i got a call from one i applied online. The next week i prayed on my knees again to get the job that i applied online for and about 5 in the evening i got a call saying i got that job. Jesus has even given me thing that i didnt praying for because He knows my heart. Everytime i had fallen away (i still do) He always brings me back to Him. He has never failed me and never will.
