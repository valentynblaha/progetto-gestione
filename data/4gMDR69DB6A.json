Can i use Postman database or any other database with Retrofit and vica versa??

Badly  written legacy code is badly written legacy code in any language, it's never fun.\n\nGood code on the other hand is something that also exists in any language, and it's always nice to work with.\n\nI've worked on native android apps in the past, both Java and Kotlin, some were completely new, some were apps that have been written years ago. I've also worked on React Native and Flutter. I also have some experience on backend side, with Java, NodeJS and C#. I'm currently working as a web React dev (since you somehow assumed that I work in Java for no reason).\n\nI've seen both horrible and beautiful code in all of those technologies. And yes, there were a few cases were Java was written in a really nice way.  \n\nIf I had to start a new mobile project today, I would first consider the requirements and after that I would take a pick between native, React Native and Flutter. They are all good technologies for certain types of projects, if you know how to use them. They can also be bad for other types of projects if you choose them only by one factor.\n\nSo, instead of being a guy saying \"my language easiest, my language best\", try to actually be a good developer.
