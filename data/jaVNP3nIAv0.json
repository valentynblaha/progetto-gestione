And even your own point is self-defeating. We can't ALL be on the same page, since VSCode has about 40% of the market right now, with Atom taking up 20%, and Sublime another 30%. So yes, it is about personal preference. Your argument would be valid if everyone was using the same editor, but the reality is that MORE people are using editors that AREN'T VSCode. And here's the thing, I think VSCode is probably the best editor that's come to market, and one of the best products Microsoft has ever released, but your \"ugh\" reaction seems to be based more on why this guy isn't using the FOTM editor, rather than any real argument against Atom, which is still an amazing editor in its own right (and is even using a shared roadmap with VSCode). Something to also keep in mind is that no tool is perfect. I ran into an issue with VSCode's Prettier plugin during the last update, as it broke formatting in several document types. I ended up working in Atom for a couple of weeks as the workaround was a bit hacky and kind of a pain in the ass. It took me about 10 minutes to install some of the additional plugins I was using in VSCode and the experience was almost identical.

Before that I had similar challenges switching from Textmate to Sublime.

They do look up the references but that part is not shown in the video. To create a tutorial video, it usually takes 5 times the length of the video to plan everything and edit everything so it looks just right. Don't get discouraged! As long as you have a few simple projects to show off, you can start applying for entry level jobs. The pay is completely based on where you live. It could be anywhere between $20k and $100k per year. If you are in United States, you should be able to get $35k in most places but it could be a lot more in bigger cities. Try cold emailing software developers in your area and offer to buy them lunch or a coffee. Then you can ask about what things are like in the city you want to work. Local developers often have a good idea of what programming languages to learn (different languages are popular in different regions) and can let you know if you skills are ready to apply.", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy-zxzWG2FOWH-3f5d4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-09T20:33:34Z", "author": "Marco Zapata", "text": "I just started with CSS and HTML a few months ago so forgive me if my question sounds silly but instead of adding font-family: Asap, sans-serif to every class that needs it wouldn't it be more productive to just add to the Universal selector the font family of Asap and just use font-family to the classes and id's you WON'T be using Asap (in case you needed)?", "likes": 6}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugy-zxzWG2FOWH-3f5d4AaABAg.8nRmrjSLI5A8p_HOmpIi3q", "publishedAt": "2019-01-01T20:45:49Z", "author": "No Matter", "text": "Check out my chanel", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugy-zxzWG2FOWH-3f5d4AaABAg.8nRmrjSLI5A8niilLJduH1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:44:04Z", "author": "OrpheuZ Development", "text": "or just add it to the body element", "likes": 1}, {"id": "Ugy-zxzWG2FOWH-3f5d4AaABAg.8nRmrjSLI5A8nSUxS8NOj0", "publishedAt": "2018-11-10T03:07:34Z", "author": "PunyuPunyuMunyu", "text": "He know and he mention that on video", "likes": 6}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyD2G6z6L84iPUSTMJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-09T20:32:38Z", "author": "Sylwester", "text": "for a beginer explain a lot , and make it easier to understand , spesialy when you learning on #freeCodeCamp.org", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyD2G6z6L84iPUSTMJ4AaABAg.8nRmkqoZXup8nfuCd8Qtlc", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:26:20Z", "author": "TheCoffeeAddict", "text": "Sylwester Zientara no.
