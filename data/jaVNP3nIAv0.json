And even your own point is self-defeating. We can't ALL be on the same page, since VSCode has about 40% of the market right now, with Atom taking up 20%, and Sublime another 30%. So yes, it is about personal preference. Your argument would be valid if everyone was using the same editor, but the reality is that MORE people are using editors that AREN'T VSCode. And here's the thing, I think VSCode is probably the best editor that's come to market, and one of the best products Microsoft has ever released, but your \"ugh\" reaction seems to be based more on why this guy isn't using the FOTM editor, rather than any real argument against Atom, which is still an amazing editor in its own right (and is even using a shared roadmap with VSCode). Something to also keep in mind is that no tool is perfect. I ran into an issue with VSCode's Prettier plugin during the last update, as it broke formatting in several document types. I ended up working in Atom for a couple of weeks as the workaround was a bit hacky and kind of a pain in the ass. It took me about 10 minutes to install some of the additional plugins I was using in VSCode and the experience was almost identical.

Although I use VSCode myself, I was an Atom user for years and it's still an amazing editor.

Before that I had similar challenges switching from Textmate to Sublime. So although I do love VSCode, if it weren't for some of the built-in functionality I'd probably still be using Atom, as I do run into some issues with VSCode that make me regret switching from time to time.\n\nSometimes using an editor isn't as easy as \"use what's popular;\" for a professional developer working full-time on a team, shipping and looking at deadlines on the horizon, the notion of switching can be a daunting, and potentially hazardous one.", "likes": 15}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mike S", "text": "Thanks for presenting and sharing a great tutorial!!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Duzant J-Laurent", "text": "ill try to build my version of this when i get home!!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Faraz Frank", "text": "best video uptill now :)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Duy Nguyen Thanh", "text": "So fantastic.
