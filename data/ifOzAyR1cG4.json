I feel like the guy is not happy about doing a tutorial or at least his voice sounds tired. But if this was the only problem... It looks like he doesn't care about making his code clean and he does not give any tools so that we can learn by ourseleves. He is just writing his code for his app using firebase functions and everything without actually saying how they work. I feel like reading firebase and vue documentation would be more usefull. Without forgeting about the fact that it is a firebase AND vue tutorial so it should maybe explain why we should use data instead of props, or created instead of mounted, explain the vue hooks and stuff like that. It might take more time but it is a more effective way to learn. Of course if you just want to create your own chat and you don't care about improving your programming skills in any way this might be a good video for you.", "likes": 20}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyxrGoVUuU5b5kejHR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-03-29T13:31:49Z", "author": "\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u044c\u0435\u0432", "text": "Messase)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzJMHRhVcxKfC2aIVB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-08T14:24:31Z", "author": "Marawa Chocolate", "text": "Is secure put firebase api key in public  ?", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzJMHRhVcxKfC2aIVB4AaABAg.92HdpUXRgVT9GgQk12yF9p", "publishedAt": "2020-11-30T14:01:12Z", "author": "PASSIVE CRYPTO EARNINGS", "text": "yes but only if your rules are in production mode.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxxD9FPnFwmi59z4uR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-12-06T21:44:20Z", "author": "Praneet Singh Roopra", "text": "This isn't one to one chat", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgylztyvtEsClrD6FCV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-09-23T13:29:18Z", "author": "Random Weed - Random Videos of Deep Web", "text": "so fetching whole collection ... thats pretty expensive", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwzgq8pXeNMf0_9r7F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-08-15T10:59:35Z", "author": "Stephen Paul", "text": "Where I can find the source code ?\nI thin the link in description is wrong.", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy9PTnSAsIpsLElyll4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-07-12T18:43:40Z", "author": "iNVICTUX", "text": "19:00 El array me lo carga con funciones, no con objetos.
