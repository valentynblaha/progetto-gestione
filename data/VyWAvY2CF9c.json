Some of the ideas probably should be reigned in a bit. For example, people who study learning do not think machine learning models how the human brain learns at all. Calling neural network nodes \"neurons\" misleads people into thinking you are actually trying to imitate a neuron instead of just using a software node. Stating that activation functions are non-linear is not always correct - in fact the equation you showed when you said that looks like a linear sum of terms.\n\nAll this doesn't take away from the work you've done to make these ideas accessible. It's a good intro - but hopefully people understand there are some sweeping statements that might not hold up under close scrutiny.", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxGxqZS4UqtmvA4_114AaABAg.9BpHHgEDqVF9Bx-3BuUUAa", "publishedAt": "2020-08-04T17:49:25Z", "author": "Reilley", "text": "Neuron and node are interchangeable enough in this context.

And the slide matches it. But 7:08 says the weight is something of a neuron (how important is the neuron, rather than how important is the relationship). I think it is confusing; aren't weights a property of the relationship/channel, in graph theory?\n* inside slides that list advantages/disadvantages you might use the color red for disadvantages, and not just always green to highlight terms. Ex. \"small\" at 29:08.\n* I like the examples of descending the Everest, and the one about memorising songs.\n* 40:21 - the slides disappears till 40:57\n* same at 52:01; till 53:11\n* 58:15 - \"sometimes you may find the ???? depicted over time\" (the automatic subtitles don't get it either)\n* 1:04:17 - audio says \"input gate, output gate, and a forget gate\"; but the slides shows \"Update, Reset & Forget gates\".\n* 1:10:30 - \"although if you are interested I'll leave them in the notes below\"; yet, it would be useful if a list (or a link to more info) could be added in the description.\n\nThese are the major notes that I think should be fixed, for better clarity.\nAnyway it is well made, a good explanatory overview of the neural networks world, that I had no idea about it.\n\nIt was ok to understand for me, if I skip on the name of the specific algorithms (that in the end are implementation details).\nBut I already got some basic knowledge of statistics & data-analysis, and about graph theory.
