Cyber security Capture The Flag (CTF) games are the perfect place to practice and learn.\n\npicoCTF is a beginner's level computer security game that consists of a series of challenges  where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.\n\nThis video is a walkthrough on how to solve the challenges from the picoCTF 2018 game. Consider trying to solve the challenges on your own first, then watch how to solve them.\n\nStart the game here: https://2018game.picoctf.com/\n\nThis walkthrough was created by John Hammond.

Prevention for DDOS attacks and ransomware attacks typically involves setting up and testing backups as well as applying ransomware protection in security tools. Security tools such as email protection gateways are the first line of defence, while endpoints are a secondary defence. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are sometimes used to detect ransomware command-and-control to alert against a ransomware system calling out to a control server.This type of services requires an expertise and that's where we come in.\nwebghost is a guru when it comes to hacking generally . He has proven to be the best I\u2019ve seen so far after a couple of jobs he\u2019s carried out for me . I recommend him for jobs like social network hacks in general , recovery of lost web accounts , school grade change , Creating a strong IP to access any website , security checks for newly created or existing websites.
