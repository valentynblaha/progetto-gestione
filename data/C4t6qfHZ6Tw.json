Watch it here or check out the interactive version at Scrimba, where you\u2019ll be able to play with the code as well: https://scrimba.com/g/gd3js\n\nD3.js is the most popular data visualization library for the web. It allows you to make sense of your data through a powerful API of methods. Throughout this course you'll learn the most important features of the library while building four different visualizations. \n\nCourse content: \n\nIntroduction (0:00)\nSelection and manipulation (1:59)\nData loading and binding (5:25)\nCreating a simple bar chart (7:29)\nCreating labels (11:16)\nScales (13:22)\nAxes (15:18)\nSVG elements (17:41)\nCreating a pie chart (20:32)\nLine charts (21:55)\n\nYou can follow the course creator Sohaib Nehal on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/Sohaib_Nehal\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com", "duration": "PT27M16S", "likes": "2742", "views": "247865"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Abdullah Shaker", "text": "Awesome tutorial \ud83d\udc4c", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Vivek Ananth", "text": "From Scales, Bar Chart is NOT working as expected.
