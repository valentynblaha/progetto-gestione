(note that it is a few years old so it does not include the handy feature of f-strings for printing formatted strings)\n\nThe Kaggle course on Python has many exercises and it is not too long so you can finish it in less than a couple days (though it is recommended to have a bit of coding experience already): https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python I've done a couple other Kaggle courses (pandas, SQL) and I feel that if you want a fast track to gaining enough skills to start tackling data science projects as quickly as possible just doing all their courses should give you a very good start.\n\nFor numpy, matplotlib and scipy: http://scipy-lectures.org/\n\nAnd here are some other resources for practicing the basics:\nhttp://www.practicepython.org/\nhttps://exercism.io/tracks/python\nhttps://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html\n\nHope this helps, good luck!", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Famliy Guy Shorts", "text": "U sound like Scammer\ud83e\udd23", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Lukman Fadlansyah", "text": "Sorry, I want to ask a question.
