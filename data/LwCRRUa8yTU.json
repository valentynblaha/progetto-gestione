Just like we learned how to add. subtract, multiply, divide, manipulate fractions, solve for Lower Common Divisible or identify prime numbers in preparation for Algebra concepts.\n\nWe forget or never had a good understanding of the lower level math concepts and have difficulty learning new material since we are struggling with getting over the hurdle of relearning material we may have struggled with in the past.\n\nThankfully, there are plenty of resources out there to help reinforce those concepts that we were lacking and take the \"math speak\" and change it to \"English\" or our own native tongue.\nSometimes we have to take a step back in order to advance which we will do so with a better foundation and the time spent refreshing previously learned concepts will not be wasted. \n\nI witnessed Nursing students and others who had non-technical majors not capable of grasping basic concepts in chemistry, electrical or other courses that required a small amount of algebraic manipulation in order to solve basic equations or better visualize concepts.  They were so focused on the stigmatism that math sucks and they couldn't do it that they did poorly and in reality it was just a matter of moving some items to the other side of the equation to balance them out.\n\nDon't get too hung-up on this math stuff, just realize it builds on itself and if you are struggling with a concept, chances are its because you may need a refresher is some concepts you may be fuzzy.  Also, since there is a bunch of resource material and your instructor may not have the best teaching skills that suite your style of learning, use the internet to supplement those teachings.\n\nI find Khanacademy .org has one of the most comprehensive and free learning platforms when it comes to math and other technical subjects.  This video too is a great resource so I am sure you may find others on this platform as well.  In addition, helping others learn while we are studying also increases our understanding of topics since we are required to explain thos concepts in better detail.\n\nKeep going it gets better...", "likes": 3}, {"author": "Vanessa Flores", "text": "I always felt bad for not being good in math i thought I was just dumb with numbers \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Kofi Dwirah\u2019s Class", "text": "I  appreciate you seeing this, students now are lucky to have these people on YouTube to learn from them.

The logic behind this is like a balance. \n\nSuppose the balance was already balanced (equal), if you either add or subract equal amounts of weight to both sides of the balance, it will stay balanced. Multiplying or dividing both sides also works with the same logic.\n\nHere's a mathematical example:\nYou have 5=5, which is a true statement.\nIf you add 3 only to the right side, then it will be 5=8 which isn't true. But, if you add 3 to both sides you will get 8=8, which is true. That's an illustration on why we add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc both sides of the equation.\n\nAnd lastly, why do we subtract in that part? Because by doing so, we can isolate the unknown variable (in this case, the unknown variable is r). By isolating, what I meant was to place it in a different side from the other terms, be it in the left side or the left side.\n\nWhy do we need to isolate the unknown variable? Because by doing so, we can find what the unknown variable is equal to. In this case, by isolating the variable she got 40r=120. \n\nFrom this we can easily find what r is equal to by dividing both sides by 40. Why 40?

As (x-2sqrtx+2)(x+2sqrtx+2). But of course, over the rationals it doesn't. And even over the integers, there is no hard rule that \"sum of squares doesn't factor\". For example, (x^2)^2+2^2=(x^2-2x+2)(x^2+2x+2).\n\n3:02:42 Common mistake. A cubic doesn't look remotely like that. It is tangent to abscissa at the origin, not passing at 45\u00b0 angle like the y=x one. Same with sqrtx: it is tangent to the ordinate at zero. That mistake is particularly jarring since you draw it about 30 times later when explaining the coordinate transforms. :-(\n\n3:14:30 People often say that, probably because they first see the y-transform and draw the wrong conclusion. It's the _coordinate system_ that's moving, not the graph, when we add to / subtract from the coordinates. x-2 instead of x moves the coordinate system 2 to the left, just as you would expect if you didn't see the y-transform first. Well, what about the y-transform, you say? Same thing, you just have to add to /subtract from the _y coordinate_, not the function value. So, it's y+2=sqrtx, and of course it moves the coordinate system 2 up.\n\n3:36:29 Of course it's not a coincidence. :-)\n\n3:50:06: By the same thinking, b shouldn't be 1 also, because it's also a constant function. :-P\n\n3:51:00 Only for positive x. For negative x it's not even defined, so it makes even less sense.\n\n5:12:37 No, these cannot happen in this context. Since exponential function (with base not 1) is injective, the transformed equation is exactly equivalent to the original one. In other words, those negative numbers will never appear under the log, since the value of exponential functions will always be positive. Of course, when you have more than one log, as in the next example, such thinking doesn't apply anymore, so maybe it's too complicated to know exactly when you should check the purported solutions---but I still think it's valuable to distinguish \"checking to calm the nerves\" (just to verify we didn't make a mistake) from \"checking as an integral part of the solving\" (when you submit your equation to the noninjective functions).\n\n5:22:11 Ridiculous. If it's componded anually, then 3.54 years is in no way special. The answer is \"4 years\" if you interpret the question as \"at least $2000\", or \"never\" if you interpret it as \"exactly $2000\".\n\n5:25:16 The overuse of ln is one of my pet peeves. Wouldn't it be easier to just take the log with the base 1.12, which is explicitly given in the equation? :-P\n\n6:15:58 Well, it's obviously meant to be 1.75. Since h(x) is quadratic function with graph vertex at (1,2), and a=-1/4 (both of them, see 3:36:29;).", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Selva krishnan", "text": "thanks good samaritan", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tungsten_Walls", "text": "lmfao, I don't seed any gay prerequisites for this, get fucked college", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Azeeza Fazlayah", "text": "What is the benefit of learning this..?
