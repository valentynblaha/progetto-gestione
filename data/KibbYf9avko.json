I need to learn how to create custom blog types like this but step by step! again I'm completely grateful for your help!", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Elena Novinskiy", "text": "\u200b@johan barrios ok, I was just curious and decided to start over with creating a custom post type. As a matter of fact I created 2, book and product, cause I wanted to try creating multiple custom post types. Here is my functions code.\n\n\nfunction book_post_type(){\n  $labels = array (\n    'name'                => _x( 'Books', 'Post Type General Name', 'text_domain' ),\n    'singular_name'       => _x( 'Book', 'Post Type Singular Name', 'text_domain' ),\n    'menu_name'           => __( 'Books', 'text_domain' ),\n    'parent_item_colon'   => __( 'Parent Item:', 'text_domain' ),\n    'all_items'           => __( 'All Books', 'text_domain' ),\n    'view_item'           => __( 'View Book', 'text_domain' ),\n    'add_new_item'        => __( 'Add New Book', 'text_domain' ),\n    'add_new'             => __( 'Add New', 'text_domain' ),\n    'edit_item'           => __( 'Edit Book', 'text_domain' ),\n    'update_item'         => __( 'Update Book', 'text_domain' ),\n    'search_items'        => __( 'Search Book', 'text_domain' ),\n    'not_found'           => __( 'Not found', 'text_domain' ),\n    'not_found_in_trash'  => __( 'Not found in Trash', 'text_domain' ),\n  );\n  $args = array(\n    'label'               => __( 'book', 'text_domain' ),\n    'description'         => __( 'Post Type Description', 'text_domain' ),\n    'labels'              => $labels,\n    'show_in_rest'        => true,//add Gutenberg Editor Support\n    'supports'            => array('title', 'thumbnail', 'editor', 'excerpt', 'comments'),\n    'taxonomies'          => array( 'category', 'post_tag' ),\n    'hierarchical'        => false,\n    'public'              => true,\n    'show_ui'             => true,\n    'show_in_menu'        => true,\n    'show_in_nav_menus'   => true,\n    'show_in_admin_bar'   => true,\n    'menu_position'       => 5,\n    'menu_icon'           => 'dashicons-clipboard',\n    'can_export'          => true,\n    'has_archive'         => true,\n    'exclude_from_search' => false,\n    'publicly_queryable'  => true,\n  );\n  register_post_type( 'book', $args );\n}\n// Hook into the 'init' action\nadd_action( 'init', 'book_post_type' );\n\n\nfunction product_post_type(){\n  $labels = array (\n    'name'                => _x( 'Products', 'Post Type General Name', 'text_domain' ),\n    'singular_name'       => _x( 'Product', 'Post Type Singular Name', 'text_domain' ),\n    'menu_name'           => __( 'Products', 'text_domain' ),\n    'parent_item_colon'   => __( 'Parent Item:', 'text_domain' ),\n    'all_items'           => __( 'All Products', 'text_domain' ),\n    'view_item'           => __( 'View Products', 'text_domain' ),\n    'add_new_item'        => __( 'Add New Product', 'text_domain' ),\n    'add_new'             => __( 'Add New', 'text_domain' ),\n    'edit_item'           => __( 'Edit Product', 'text_domain' ),\n    'update_item'         => __( 'Update Product', 'text_domain' ),\n    'search_items'        => __( 'Search Product', 'text_domain' ),\n    'not_found'           => __( 'Not found', 'text_domain' ),\n    'not_found_in_trash'  => __( 'Not found in Trash', 'text_domain' ),\n  );\n  $args = array(\n    'label'               => __( 'product', 'text_domain' ),\n    'description'         => __( 'Post Type Description', 'text_domain' ),\n    'labels'              => $labels,\n    'show_in_rest'        => true,//add Gutenberg Editor Support\n    'supports'            => array('title', 'thumbnail', 'editor', 'excerpt', 'comments'),\n    'taxonomies'          => array( 'category', 'post_tag' ),\n    'hierarchical'        => false,\n    'public'              => true,\n    'show_ui'             => true,\n    'show_in_menu'        => true,\n    'show_in_nav_menus'   => true,\n    'show_in_admin_bar'   => true,\n    'menu_position'       => 9,\n    'menu_icon'           => 'dashicons-clipboard',\n    'can_export'          => true,\n    'has_archive'         => true,\n    'exclude_from_search' => false,\n    'publicly_queryable'  => true,\n  );\n  register_post_type( 'product', $args );\n}\n// Hook into the 'init' action\nadd_action( 'init', 'product_post_type' );\n\n\nAfter this I went ahead and created several book posts and several product posts. When I went to check is I get respective post pages and post feeds I also got Page Not Found. So I went to Setting > Permalinks. I had it set to \"Post name\" from the very beginning. So I did not change anything there. I just clicked Save Changes. And then everything started working as it should.\n\n\nYou are welcome to use this code. I just find this way it is a bit more structured and there is less arrays within arrays. Also keep in mind that the function name cannot exceed 20 characters including underscores. So your function ep_custom_post_type() is 19 characters. I would name it simply ep_post_type() or something to make it shorter.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "johan barrios", "text": "I've cleared the cache on my browser but sadly no change, I've tried the settings - permalink - save step but still nothing happens, when I click project it doesn't show the posts that I've created and on the browser nav tab still says \"Page not found\"  :/.  Is there any specific setting that the permalink should have?\n\nBtw here I add the while loop that I have for the index.php:\n<?php \n  while (have_posts(  )){\n    the_post(  );\n  ?>\n\nAnd the function for the custom blog  type:\nfunction ep_custom_post_type(){\n  register_post_type( 'project', \n  array(\n    'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'projects'),\n    'labels' => array(\n      'name' => 'Projects',\n      'singular_name' => 'Project',\n      'add_new_item' => 'Add New Project',\n      'edit_item' => 'Edit Project',\n    ),\n    'menu_icon' => 'dashicons-clipboard',\n    'public' => true,\n    'has_archve' => true,\n    'supports' => array(\n      'title','thumbnail','editor','excerpt', 'comments'\n    ) \n  )\n    );  \n} \n\nadd_action( 'init','ep_custom_post_type');\n\n\nI really can't seem to find the error :/, thank you so much for your support.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "johan barrios", "text": "@Elena Novinskiy Thank you so much!
