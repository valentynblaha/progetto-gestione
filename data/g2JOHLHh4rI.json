You'll be an AWS VPC guru in no time!\n\nAn AWS VPC is a logically isolated portion of the cloud into which you can deploy your resources. You get complete control over the networking environment including IP address ranges, subnets, routing, firewalls and more. \n\nAfter going through the theory using animated diagrams to help explain the concepts, you'll be able to learn-by-doing with many practical lessons.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Download the code for the hands-on lessons here: https://digitalcloud.training/aws-vpc-deep-dive-download/\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course developed by Neal Davis, Founder of Digital Cloud Training.
