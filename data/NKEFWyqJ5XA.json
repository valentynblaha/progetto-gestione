Hope this helps others:\n\n* My exam had 35 questions, but about 10 of them had 3 true/false statements inside each one of them. They say each true/false = 1 point, so the whole questions is worth 3 points total.\n\n* There were 3 questions that presented me a screenshot from the management panel and asked me to click the icon where I could perform XXX in Azure.  You click the image and it highlights the icon you've clicked.\n\n* People seem confused about the length of the test: the official sitting time is 60 minutes, of which 15 minutes are reserved for surveys and agreements, and 45 minutes are reserved for the questions. \nBut IF you are doing it from home or office,  you should check-in 30 minutes prior to the scheduled time so you can go through the crappy PersonVUE process. So, in total:  \n30min before the scheduled time(check-in *IF* remote) + 15min(surveys) + 45min(questions).\n\n* Do not pay for the exam! Google \"Microsoft Virtual Training Days\", subscribe to a 2 days training from Microsoft (2.5 hours each, with no labs and no tests) and they'll give you a voucher for a az-900 exam for free. Check it out on the Training Day description page, inside the \"After completing this training, you will be able to:\" section it should say \"Take the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification exam at no cost\".  Also, AZ-900 is the only exam that have that option, so don't burn other kinds of \"100% off\" vouchers for it!  Save the voucher for other exams that don't have the virtual training days option.\r\n\n* The questions are short and straightforward. Shouldn't take you more than 30 seconds each (a little longer for true/false packs).\n\n*This is the only material I've used to study besides the 2 day training from Microsoft but I am already familiar with AWS, so some of the knowledge applied.   I would suggest some practice exams if you have no experience working on cloud. Try CloudConnect practice exams on Udemy. Their pratice exams are very close to the IRL exam.\n\n*You get the full score report immediately after finishing the exame. Your certificate is available in about 15min and the credly badge shows up in about 20min.  Way better than AWS in this regard.\n\nPlease let me know if I forgot something.", "likes": 15}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugz9FaWEOvQsz7i9kIN4AaABAg.9fEqIs4d_0q9fc6JCR1hpv", "publishedAt": "2022-09-06T03:21:56Z", "author": "Nene", "text": "You\u2019re awesome!!

One thing that deserves clarification is the public subnet and private subnet concept.  \nAWS VPC subnets can either be private or public. A subnet is public if it has an internet gateway (IGW) attached. AWS allows only one IGW per VPC and the public subnet allow resources deployed in them access to the internet. AWS creates a default VPC and subnets for each region. This default VPC has subnets for each region where the VPC resides, and any image (EC2 instance) deployed to this VPC will be assigned a public IP address and hence has internet connectivity. Azure VNet does not provide a default VNet and does not have private or public subnet as in AWS VPC. Resources connected to a VNet have access to the Internet, by default.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxSlovQIeuCrtRWenh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-29T10:45:14Z", "author": "Rahul Kumar", "text": "Nicely explained.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwlfpmWSQphSCOuU2l4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-28T11:32:55Z", "author": "ROBIN", "text": "azure 104 please ....Thank you Andrew", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzs3KCEkfEnWtKpScp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-28T11:04:56Z", "author": "Darth Mal", "text": "This video would be half the time if you stopped introducing yourself at every page.", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgygoReg4kh3K7ThcJB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-28T06:57:23Z", "author": "Sanchit Kapur", "text": "Course Good For Basic knowledge of Azure.. one cannot pass the exam with this course alone.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyGMJ1jTqVS0qLjJ1x4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-27T18:03:24Z", "author": "Dan J", "text": "Can you please do one for the Azure Administrator certificate", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyueQKEKTI4Alr3Ci14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-27T03:05:42Z", "author": "Jisan Mahfuz", "text": "is the slides here downloadable?", "likes": 5}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxUCJ5-GbDmLe8wQsx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-09-26T10:51:11Z", "author": "Eduhazard", "text": "He just read the texts, nothing deeper but its good to have an overview.
