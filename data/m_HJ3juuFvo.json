However, I have run into a couple of issues that have caused me to pause the recording and try to fix them because knowing those errors exist literally bugging me which means I cannot carry on lol.\n\nI ran into a couple of issues the first is the one you mentioned where you can pass in 0000 and it will still validate \n\n2) the second issue is if the user enters an infinite number where the digits are well infinite so to speak and hits calculate then the number literally goes off the screen. If the user enters any number greater than 100000000 then it bleeds into the expenses field and the same happens to the expense field if it exceeds a certain range of digits where it then bleeds in the balance field.\n\nFix 1 regarding the validation of 000 number was to add \"=\" sign inside the validation if statement.\n\nThe original if-statement was only validating if the number was less than \"0\" and since \"0\" is not less than \"0\" it validates\n\nOriginal code:\nif (value === ' ' || value < 0) {\n         perform some action .......\n}\n\nChanged the code to \n\nif (value === ' ' || parseFloat(value) <= 0) {\n         perform some action .......\n}\n\n\n2. The second fix required a little trial and error in order to find the number of digits that would cause the number entered by the user to bleed into the expense field. I discovered that if the user was to enter a number greater than 999999 then it bled into the other fields.\n\nTo rectify it I placed a cap to the number the user can enter in both the form fields by adding max=\"9999999\". So now if the user was to enter a number with say ten thousand digits the HTML message will be displayed to inform them that they cannot exceed 999999. I also move the dollar sign and placed next to headings so it looks like \"Budget $\", \"Expenses $\" and \"Balance $\" to create more space for the numbers.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Photo", "text": "How much we will get maximum", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Gustavo Moncada", "text": "Only 2 minutes in I already pressed like", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Myles Gmail", "text": "i tweeted this, thx", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Leo Gansallo-sadiq", "text": "Hi, this is exactly what i needed.
