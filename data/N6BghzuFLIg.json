The model of ethnographic studies is based on the researcher following participants or subjects into their culture to gain more insight into cultural issues. A metaphor of an ethnographic study is following customers to their home to understand why they purchase a given product and not another. The three paradigms of ethnographic studies include behaviorist, semiotic, and holistic styles. Interviews and surveys are the specific techniques embraced in ethnographic studies (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe narrative method includes the use of two main techniques; interviews or collecting information from person\u2019s documents that include diaries, memoirs, and other personal encounters narrative documents. The narrative is selected carefully to be a metaphor of the whole population, for instance, someone narrating how a calamity strikes their community might be narrative that can tell what the whole community experienced. The models of narratives can be spoken, written, or visually represented. The paradigm is that what one person experienced does not differ significantly from what the rest of the community experienced concerning the specific problem being analyzed (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe third methodology is the phenomenological study which embraces multiple techniques that include interviews, surveys, literature review, and others to describe phenomena. The main models embraced in the phenomenological study include purposive sampling and systematic sampling. The metaphor of this method is that the collection of data from varying sources will give a united theme and data relevant to understanding the phenomena. The paradigm, hereby, is that the collected data about a certain phenomenon will show common features about the phenomena (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe fourth method is grounded theory. It is closely associated with the phenomenological study in that it embraces the use of varying sources of information to develop a theme and collect data about phenomena. Its techniques, models, metaphor, and paradigms are similar to those of the phenomenological study (described in the paragraph above), but unlike phenomenological studies that look into the essence of an event or activity, the grounded theory seeks to give theories or explanations behind an occurrence or event (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe fifth quantitative research methodology is the case study method. This method looks into occurrences as they affected a subject or few subjects. The techniques in this method include a single subject case study or multiple subjects\u2019 case studies. The models of inquiry may include interviews, observations, or literature review for past events case studies. This model has a paradigm that what happens to one person applies to other people with a similar problem in society (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\n\r\n2.\tSelect the best quantitative method and assess the strengths and weaknesses of that selected method defending why the selected quantitative method is the best. 80 words\r\nThe best qualitative method in my opinion is an ethnographic study. Given my interest in social science, I find that understanding the behavior of a given group through interacting with the group is the best model to use. Moreover, unlike case study design this method allows for interaction with a larger number of participants or subjects with similar concerns. Moreover, it is a method that develops a hypothesis that can be approved or disapproved by the research, unlike the phenomenological and grounded theory designs that look for common themes during the active research. One of the weaknesses of ethnographic studies is that it can consume a huge amount of time. The researcher can also be faced with great challenges fitting in with a new culture and gaining their trust after s/he declares interest to understand their cultural elements.\r\n\r\n3.\tCompare various quantitative methods and how each method enables researchers to design the correct series of questions and eventually hypotheses to prove the theories. 120 words  \r\nThe ethnographic study follows researchers into their cultural roots to understand their behavior. It is appropriate for cultural studies that aim to understand behavior such as consumer behavior. The narrative aims at gaining opinions from specific subjects, or their encounters concerning a certain problem. It closely relates to the case study design which also focuses on individual\u2019s stories. These two methods can yield results in understanding people\u2019s reactions to certain societal problems, for instance, the experiences that parents undergo after losing a job. The phonological studies and grounded theory methodologies are similar in many aspects including the fact that they seek a common theme from multiple sources of information such as interviews, literature, surveys, and other sources.

The model of ethnographic studies is based on the researcher following participants or subjects into their culture to gain more insight into cultural issues. A metaphor of an ethnographic study is following customers to their home to understand why they purchase a given product and not another. The three paradigms of ethnographic studies include behaviorist, semiotic, and holistic styles. Interviews and surveys are the specific techniques embraced in ethnographic studies (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe narrative method includes the use of two main techniques; interviews or collecting information from person\u2019s documents that include diaries, memoirs, and other personal encounters narrative documents. The narrative is selected carefully to be a metaphor of the whole population, for instance, someone narrating how a calamity strikes their community might be narrative that can tell what the whole community experienced. The models of narratives can be spoken, written, or visually represented. The paradigm is that what one person experienced does not differ significantly from what the rest of the community experienced concerning the specific problem being analyzed (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe third methodology is the phenomenological study which embraces multiple techniques that include interviews, surveys, literature review, and others to describe phenomena. The main models embraced in the phenomenological study include purposive sampling and systematic sampling. The metaphor of this method is that the collection of data from varying sources will give a united theme and data relevant to understanding the phenomena. The paradigm, hereby, is that the collected data about a certain phenomenon will show common features about the phenomena (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe fourth method is grounded theory. It is closely associated with the phenomenological study in that it embraces the use of varying sources of information to develop a theme and collect data about phenomena. Its techniques, models, metaphor, and paradigms are similar to those of the phenomenological study (described in the paragraph above), but unlike phenomenological studies that look into the essence of an event or activity, the grounded theory seeks to give theories or explanations behind an occurrence or event (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\nThe fifth quantitative research methodology is the case study method. This method looks into occurrences as they affected a subject or few subjects. The techniques in this method include a single subject case study or multiple subjects\u2019 case studies. The models of inquiry may include interviews, observations, or literature review for past events case studies. This model has a paradigm that what happens to one person applies to other people with a similar problem in society (Park, & Park, 2016).\r\n\r\n2.\tSelect the best quantitative method and assess the strengths and weaknesses of that selected method defending why the selected quantitative method is the best. 80 words\r\nThe best qualitative method in my opinion is an ethnographic study. Given my interest in social science, I find that understanding the behavior of a given group through interacting with the group is the best model to use. Moreover, unlike case study design this method allows for interaction with a larger number of participants or subjects with similar concerns. Moreover, it is a method that develops a hypothesis that can be approved or disapproved by the research, unlike the phenomenological and grounded theory designs that look for common themes during the active research. One of the weaknesses of ethnographic studies is that it can consume a huge amount of time. The researcher can also be faced with great challenges fitting in with a new culture and gaining their trust after s/he declares interest to understand their cultural elements.\r\n\r\n3.\tCompare various quantitative methods and how each method enables researchers to design the correct series of questions and eventually hypotheses to prove the theories. 120 words  \r\nThe ethnographic study follows researchers into their cultural roots to understand their behavior. It is appropriate for cultural studies that aim to understand behavior such as consumer behavior. The narrative aims at gaining opinions from specific subjects, or their encounters concerning a certain problem. It closely relates to the case study design which also focuses on individual\u2019s stories. These two methods can yield results in understanding people\u2019s reactions to certain societal problems, for instance, the experiences that parents undergo after losing a job. The phonological studies and grounded theory methodologies are similar in many aspects including the fact that they seek a common theme from multiple sources of information such as interviews, literature, surveys, and other sources. However, the grounded theory seeks to explain or develop a theory describing a certain societal concern, while the phenomenological study looks into the essence of the societal concern of interest. \r\nThe ethnographic study, case study, and narrative begin with preparations that include the identification of the societal problem, development of research questions, and a hypothesis that the study will either approve or disapprove. The phenomenological study and the grounded theory designs, on the other hand, have a planning process that only includes the identification of the problem and sources from which information will be obtained. These two quantitative methodologies develop a common theme in the field of study, which gives research questions to be responded to and maybe a hypothesis which is not mandatorily essential.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tRecommend best methods to solve different types of analysis and provide a table that outlines each method, what type variables are used, best applications, and what findings to expect. 100 words\r\n\r\n\tDescriptive analysis\tPredictive analysis\tDiagnostic analysis\tPrescriptive Analysis\r\nRecommended Method\tCase study, cross-sectional research, surveys,  naturalistic observation, archival research, and longitudinal research\tAnalytics techniques such as regression models, time series, and others. \tCase studies, questionnaires, interviews, surveys, and observations \tMathematical learning and machine learning methods\r\nTypes of Variables\tDescriptive variables such as \u201cagree or disagree\u201d\tPredictor variables; variables linked with certain outcomes such as regression variables\tDescriptive variables such as a scale of 0-10 in rating pain\tBoth predictor and descriptive variables\r\nBest Application\tUnderstanding phenomena\tExtrapolation of past and current events into uncertain or future predictions\tUnderstanding personal outcomes such as feelings, opinions, and others\tBig data analytics essential in making an informed recommendation\r\nExpected Findings\tMore understanding of the phenomena that has already occurred or is occurring\tForecasts of what is to happen\tAn understanding of personal outcomes\tRecommendations for courses of action", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzYXiL3P-X4tgt9wIN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-22T09:39:03Z", "author": "Ray Penbar", "text": "Awesome breakdown on this topic Max!
