This occurs because you multiply by ord(i), which is the byte value of the last scanned character: imagine this last byte is a big-enough power of 2, when you multiply by it, and then take the \"modulo table_size\"; if this table_size is a power of 2, you always get 0 in the final hash (which means that all these keys will fill the collision list on the 1st bucket of the hash table, which then degenerates into a single long linked list, and so you loose ALL the interest of hash tables in terms of CPU time)! So your example function is mostly hashing only the end of strings (it has many more collisions for very different contents of the beginning of input key strings than there are collisions for the same variations at end of input key strings).\n\nThe same happens for EVERY table_size value, when it can be a multiple of a byte value. Note also that the byte value 0 of characters found in keys will cancell all accumulated hash value from the beginin of the string (independantly of the content and length of this start of string).\n\nIn a course about hash tables, the \"custom hashing function\" MUST respect a flattened distribution of its output bits, for every possible table size (see Knuth for modular hashing functions): every implementer of hash tables MUST learn how to build CORRECT hashing functions... this was not your case, sorry, but please don't tell others to imitate when you did!\n\nHERE IS THE FIX: Instead of multiplying by ord(i) in function custom_hash, you MUST multiply by a large enough ODD integer constant, and preferably a prime, so that it cannot be a multiple of table_size (e.g. 8171=largest 13-bit prime, 16301=largest 14-bit prime, 32707=largest 15-bit prime): this will lways work with any table_size lower than this prime constant (and will work very well for hashing series of bytes of variable length, like text strings). Many simple examples in Java, C or C++ just use one of 17, 67, 127, 129 or 257 as the prime multiplier for their simple modular hashing function. [Multiplying by integer constants of the form (2^n-1) or (2^n+1) is very simple to compute on the most modest CPUs without an efficient multiplication instruction and without any \"barrel-shifter\", just by using a few integer additions]. In all cases, using a good constant multiplier will even be FASTER then your code using a variable multiplier.\n\n\r\nAs well a good string hashing function should use the total length of the source string as one of its input [if this requires scanning the string, like in C/C++ null-terminated strings used by str*() functions in the classic C library, just hash bytes and count them until you find the terminating null byte, then use the count as an additional value to add to the result, before it is truncated to modulo the table_size; but you may terminate the scan early by only scanning and hashing the first 256 bytes at most for practical cases, to limit the time to compute the hash on very large keys, such as the binary contents of files like images, or videos, but in general those files should have already metadata containing a strong enough hash should as SHA1 or SHA256].\n\nNote that hashing string can even be faster by reading groups of bytes into single 32-bit or 64-bit integer value before adding this value to the hash and multiplying the result it by the prime constant (this saves the cost of multiplications, which may be slower than packing group of bytes into a 32-bit or 34-bit value, possibly accelerated when all strings are allocated in blocks allocated on 32-bit or 64-bit address boundaries, and when their allocated buffer always includes extra \"ward\" null bytes stored at end of the allocated memory, instead of having any odd buffer sizes, in order to avoid memory access exceptions when reading a few bytes past the end of buffers: these ward bytes must however be initialized to zeroes, and may eventually be protected against write accesses after their initialization, if there's ever some hardware support for it).\n\nHash tables in default simple implementations used in C++ standard libraries, Java, .Net/CLI, PHP, Lua, Python, Lisp... all use a Knuth modular algorithm by multiplying by a good prime (\"good primes\" should be fixed-width integer constants having roughly the same number of bits set to \"1\" as the number of bits set to \"0\", considering also that the least significant bit is necessarily a \"1\", because all primes larger than 2 are necessarily odd integers).\n\nyou may use more flattened distributions using secure digests, including MD5 or SHA1 (even if they are deprecated for strong security usages, in favor of SHA2 algorithms like SHA256, SHA384, SHA512), but at the price of being a slower to compute (even if there are good implementations in most OSes and libraries, already using accelerated instructions of CPUs or GPUs); some CPUs also include their own accelerated digest-computing instructions (which may use something else than modular arithmetic based on additions/multiplication of integers, e.g. using products of polynoms, or accelerated FFT transforms, or one of the common computing or bit-shuffling passes used in wellknown security digests: computing a strong hash of arbitrarily long strings is also highly parallelizable, e.g. by using a good \"MAC\" function for recombining partial hashes computed in parallel from different segments of the input text, which is then processed in a Merkle tree)...\r\n\r\n\nThanks for this correction!", "likes": 5}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwNmfjxmvg5LgPmmUx4AaABAg.9Vn52mzLsQH9cpaYaKG2EG", "publishedAt": "2022-06-28T19:30:52Z", "author": "Patrick McDermott", "text": "this response taught me quite a lot, and I can see why you would need/should to use a constant odd prime number for the multiplication of ord, I appreciate the time you took to type it all out.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxB3Q_PdwUtyad7uYR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-12-01T08:57:19Z", "author": "Citizen Of Earth", "text": "Thanks!

A few comments:\n\n1. In the *linked_list.LinkedList()* class, instead of *get_user_by_id()*, a *search()* function with a *match()* callback (defined in the server that returns True and False) will decouple the server code from the implementation. That way we can make the *LinkedList()* completely generic.\n2. In the *hash_table.HashTable()* class, I think a good idea will be to compose the *self.hash_table* array as an array of the above linked-list code and leverage it inside the *insert()* and *search()* method to avoid duplication. With *insert_at_end()* and *search()* from linked list already at hand, it might simplify the hash table implementation. I am still reading up on hash functions, so no comments on that :P\n3. The Stack and Queue classes can inherit LinkedList directly. If we implement an additional *remove_head()* function in the LinkedList class, then the Stack interface will simply become *push()* -> *insert_beginning()* and *pop()* -> *remove_head()*. Similarly for Queue, *enqueue()* -> *insert_at_end()* and *dequeue()* -> *remove_head()*. I guess that will reduce code and also explain nice properties of inheritance.\n4. In *binary_search_tree.BinarySearchTree()*, I think we can make the mother *insert()* and *search()* functions directly recursive without auxiliary functions and also some steps can be eliminated since the terminal condition you defined already takes care of insertion or returning. My attempt: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manojbaishya/FlaskAPIdemo/development/src/flaskapidemo/binary_search_tree.py\n5. I suppose a good way to illustrate the Queue usage is to have an endpoint insert multiple blogposts for a single user, with the payload transferred as an array of objects.\n\nI guess that in a real-world website, our boss will tell us to use SQL queries on the database engine directly to do insertions and deletions instead of implementing our own data structures (which will significantly simplify the design). Nevertheless, this is an excellent tutorial and removes some of the abstractnesses of data structures concepts in general.\n\nOne idea might be to add more classes to the model to learn database design and use the routes to understand SQL queries.\n\nOn Tooling: If using VS Code, everything in this video can be done within the editor:\n\n1.
