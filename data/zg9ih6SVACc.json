This way, your program smartly adapts to the kind of work that needs to be done on the data in question depending on what kind of work needs to be done on it.

You have to know the key.\n\nAwesome tutorial!\n\nBTW, I think the spell checker algo also needs knowledge of keyboard positions, to estimated-guess where a fat finger might have slipped. Which makes this even more complex. \n\nAdvanced mode would be trajectory awareness, as a similar and paralel system to tries based word completion.  Then again, it would be interesting to test at which point of error-density (eg constantly missing keys) while autocorrection correctly taking over it would still be \"somewhat uncomfortable\" (a feeling of not being in control etc).\n\nI think autocorrection should never intervene within word boundaries but wait for the space bar.\n\nSuggestion and autocorrection must be separate.\n\nContext-awareness is the gold mine for suggestions, and to some degree also for AC. This is where I feel even advanced systems, like my trusted Google Pixel keypad, still struggle a lot.\n\nSo many times I caught the system not being topic or context aware, offering more or less probability based stuff, not logical items, that fit that context or topic.

You won't be as lost as you would've been if you were self learning everything from scratch. Also, you will be surrounded by like-minded individuals who is also learning the same thing as you. You will be able to network with people with ease which is crucial for job hunting and looking for opportunities. If you want to learn by yourself, it will be more difficult but it is doable.
