This way, your program smartly adapts to the kind of work that needs to be done on the data in question depending on what kind of work needs to be done on it. This will show the best results when a program is using large data sets for a variety of different things at different times.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Dawit Tufa", "text": "Ok thankyou somuch my brother now tuti a computer science course re to post my bra", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "mehdi smaeili", "text": "Excellent.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Hassan Faizan", "text": "just subscribed your channel, the nullpointer exception\nI just want to know will this video lecutre be good enough to go for a internship interview.

Which makes this even more complex. \n\nAdvanced mode would be trajectory awareness, as a similar and paralel system to tries based word completion.  Then again, it would be interesting to test at which point of error-density (eg constantly missing keys) while autocorrection correctly taking over it would still be \"somewhat uncomfortable\" (a feeling of not being in control etc).\n\nI think autocorrection should never intervene within word boundaries but wait for the space bar.\n\nSuggestion and autocorrection must be separate.\n\nContext-awareness is the gold mine for suggestions, and to some degree also for AC. This is where I feel even advanced systems, like my trusted Google Pixel keypad, still struggle a lot.\n\nSo many times I caught the system not being topic or context aware, offering more or less probability based stuff, not logical items, that fit that context or topic.

Then at later moments I will first check if a position has been reached before and if so , read the evaluation-value and directly stop any further search.\nTo avoid collisions and/or a high loadfactor , I found a way to keep the hash-table having a minimum of members.\nA 3-ply move order (aBc) has 2 tranposition :  (cBa) .  A 4-ply move order has 4 mutations etc.\nSo upfront , at the time I store a position-value pair into the table , I know the maximum times it can be checked and I store that number in the table too .. I call it UseCnt .\nSo the next time I check for a transposition and succesfully found it : I can decrement  UseCnt . And when it is zero , I can delete the position from the hashtable , thus freeing up space for next entries.\nSo , although the size of the hashtable stays the same , the occupation changes dynamically.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "onomatopoeial", "text": "1:44:00 is  it still O(1) if we want to insert/delete the tail node? it makes sense for head node but feels like it should be O(n) for tail", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rozenrick Chanda", "text": "This awesome explanation thumbs up", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "J R", "text": "Where are the time stamps?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "DoseofDavid", "text": "can someone please explain the difference between accessing and searching .
