It's a very handy tool for the working programmer, but it's often shrouded in off-putting mathematics.\n\nIn this talk, I'll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well.  Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets.\n\nYou can understand Big-O even if you aren't a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn't as mystical as it appears. It's wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn't have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave.\n\nTalk given by Ned Batchelder at PyCon 2018.\n\nThanks to PyCon for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.

That way when I shrink my dataset (input data), I see the most speedup ha ha.  Actually this works, such as if you wanted to sort 1000 numbers, instead of using one big bubble sort which would have about 500,000 comparisons, you can instead break it up into 10 smaller groups of 100 numbers each, so that would be about 5,000 comparisons for each small group, so only about 50,000 total (1/10th as many as previously).  Then of course you would have to merge the results back together.  You could even break up the 1,000 numbers to sort into even smaller groups, such as 100 groups, each of size 10.  My question is this... if Mergesort already does this, by breaking a \"large\" array of numbers into single entry arrays, and then recombines them in a sorted way, but mergesort has a different big O time complexity vs. bubblesort, then what happens to the time complexity of bubblesort in an intermediate stage of divide and conquer (breaking the 1,000 entries up into say 100 arrays of size 10 each, bubble sorting each size 10 array, and then merging all the results into 1 big array of size 1,000).  When does it transition from O(n^2) to something else \"faster\" is my main question.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "jursamaj", "text": "You're on your way to  re-inventing quicksort\u2026\n\nThink about it this way: let's split the list into sqrt(n) lists, each of size sqrt(n).  Sort each list, then merge the lists.\n\nEach list is size sqrt(n), so bubblesorting that is O(sqrt(n)^2)=O(n).  But you have sqrt(n) lists, so sorting them all is O(n*sqrt(n)).  The merge has to find the smallest item from the lists, which is O(sqrt(n)), and it has to do that n times, so overall it's also O(n*sqrt(n)).  That is indeed faster than the bubblesort on the whole list.  Of course, it ignores all the overhead involved.  For small n, the basic bubblesort will actually be faster.  (This is that 'small cases' bit Ned mentioned.)\n\nNow you might think, \"I have this faster sort, why not use it instead of bubblesort on each small list?\"  In other words, do 2 layers of splitting.  I'm not doing the full analysis, but I think that would cut it from O(n^1.5) to O(n^1.25).  Maybe that low, but not lower.  It will still be a polynomial in n, just with an exponent that heads towards 1 with more layers (but never gets to 1).\n\nQuicksort does something similar, but because it only splits the list in 2 at each step, each layer of splitting & merging is only O(n).  And you only need O(logn) layers of splitting.  So overall, it's O(nlogn) which is less than any polynomial.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "jeskers", "text": "Clear and patient teaching style. Wonderful.

Mathematics** *is something he either doesn't understand or is doing by accident* \n\nOriginal Comment:\nDepends on how sensitive and invested you are. I believe when arithmetic * became mathematics * was much later than most. If you look at AlQuarizme or Plato they were doing it because they thought of it as physics/religion, as a duty to learn it.\n\nArchemedis might have been a freak early mathematician* or a very devoted \"believer\" in the power of mathematics idk\n\nJump forward to Euler, as I define it \"The Calculus\" is still arithmetic* as is Eulers work. They were brilliant, but did it for prestige (jumping back, the cubic duels were a great example of the closed source \"mystic\" wisdom as these the so called  \"mathematicians\" driving force.)\n\nSome were brilliant, and it's no diss. But when Gauss entered the scene everything changed. He didn't even bother to publish some if his work, but would gladly confer with worthy \"mathematicians\"/mathematician*s (not caring of gender sterotypes taken as truth ar the rime) and left most of his findings unpublished. He was doing mathematics* as I define it, chasing that light bulb moment, and when people developed the ability to learn for the sake of learning mathematics exploded. No longer was it lagging behing physics, and explored only for other causes as prior. Now math was ahead (a great example is Noethers Theorem, where mathematician* Emmy Noether solved a lingering arduous problem and shed light on \"conservation\" laws less than a half hour after being brought into a discussion by Einstein and .....Maxwell I think)\n\n*Mathematics is learning for the sake if learning, out if sheer interest with no care of practical reprocusions. Every constrain is necessarily non-optional. Sometimes reality presents interesting puzzles, but its the interest and the challenge; not the reality that drives the mathematician*\nThier are brilliant Arithmetist out there, who care about real problems and use mathematical ideas to solve them, maybe even developing the field as needed. \n\nI guess the point is, you could be doing mathematics and loving and not knowing it because standard conventions scare you but you still desire that pure light bulb moment.
