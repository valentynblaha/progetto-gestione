Attempting to\r\nget a computer to complete a specific task without making mistakes. The more\r\nexact instructions the computer gets, the better it will perform it's task. A\r\ncomputer is not intelligent on it's own. Programming makes the computer\r\nintelligent. A computer is much like a human, we both need knowledge in order to\r\nperform various tasks. The computer becomes as smart as the human makes it.\r\nFilling a program with as much details as possible is in other words what should\r\nbe done, so that the computer may execute the wanted task flawlessly.\r\n- Programming is done through binaries (ones and zeros), but code writing has\r\nvarious languages. Codes are converted to binaries within the computer. Much like\r\na human learning a new language in order to speak to somebody from another\r\ncountry, a human must learn a coding language in order to \"speak\" to a computer.\r\n- Programming languages can be split into two main categories, \"low-level\" and\r\n\"high-level\". Where high-level programming languages are such as Python and Java,\r\nwhile \"low-level\" are such as Assembly or C. The lower level a language has, the\r\ncloser it is to pure binary code. Languages are therefor a matter of preference.\r\nLearn all programming languages in order to become a master, but start with Java\r\nand/or Python.", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Betzon", "text": "Question 1: What is programming?\r\nQuestion 2: How do we write code?\r\nQuestion 3: How do we get information from computers?\r\nQuestion 4: What can computers do?\r\nQuestion 5: What are variables?\r\nQuestion 6: How do we manipulate variables?\r\nQuestion 7: What are conditional Statements?\r\nQuestion 8: What are arrays?\r\nQuestion 9: What are loops?\r\nQuestion 10: What are errors?\r\nQuestion 11: How do we debug code?\r\nQuestion 12: What are functions?\r\nQuestion 13: How do we import functions?\r\nQuestion 14: How do we make our own functions?\r\nQuestion 15: What are arraylists and dictionaries?\r\nQuestion 16: How do we use data structures?\r\nQuestion 17: What is recursion?\r\nQuestion 18: What is pseudocode?\r\nQuestion 19: Choosing the right language (explain why).\r\nQuestion 20: Applications of programming (give examples).", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Betzon", "text": "They have 20 \"questions\" in the beginning, each question is answered through the parts of the video.

I've tried starting videos or free courses to learn python, but I'm always feeling like I don't know what the hell is going on and need to somehow cover even more basic stuff. It's like \"wait how does the computer know that the parenthesis means something, where are th 1s and 0s, how does this electric box even convert these sentences into English text, how does it know to put those pixels in that manner\" like I'm just always questioning basics I feel I missed out on\n\nI don't own a computer, I use my phone for everything, because I can't afford a $4000 editing or gaming computer despite always trying to save up for it, but I still am trying to learn code for the first time, and this video ABSOLUTELY was exactly what I needed. It covers all those hyper basic questions I had right away in the beginning. I could not feel more out of place by this challenge, videos about code talk about stuff I couldn't even conceive of like \"data structures\" or \"logic strings\" or something, and I have no clue what those even are, nor can I think of why I would ever use them.\n\nI wanna figure out how to make my computer help with basic video editing, like just recognizing my voice in a recording or even in a script, and finding pictures or clips relating to what I'm saying and automatically place those on the time-line on Adobe Premiere so it doesn't take literal months to make a single video.\n\nAlso I'd like to learn how to make those quick clicking bots people use to make fast stock and options trades or buy concert tickets or limited edition objects in a millisecond because no human is able to make those.\n\nWhen I started learning editing, the ideas I had about the creative things I could do grew out of nothing, like I literally couldn't have imagined some of the things I eventually did right at the start, the knowledge forged my creativity of what I could do because i knew what was possible. I am hopeful that learning code will have the same effect, it will help direct my creativity toward coming up with new ideas of what uses I could creatively have for code \n\nThis video is great, I'm literally below an absolute beginner, I feel like I'm below zero, like im a negative beginner because of confusion I've gotten while trying to learn, so this has ABSOLUTELY helped me and I am eternally grateful.

I give up on a lot of things or get discouraged or stop because I get disillusioned after real world experience and application, or get distracted and fully forget. So PLEASE if anyone sees this, check in on me, ask if I'm still learning coding or what I've used coding for.

Idk, I think I'm just stressing. The community of CS online helps me not feel alone as cringy as that sounds. It really helps knowing other people feel similar & are only just beginning.

Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.

In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tim Lea", "text": "Fantastic introduction to programming and computer science.
