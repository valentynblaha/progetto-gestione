I would say these attributes are useful:\n\n- Get used to studying for long periods of time (reading and understanding), The Pomodoro system is very good for this. \n- Practice picking up on key words in text and making really organised notes. (notes are probably the no1 key to passing exams).\n- Learning how to write and structure assignments is probably an underrated skill that you should practice. \n- Get familiar with what CS or any degree entails, look at the university course content that is covered and do some research into what each unit/subject is about. \n\nTheres more but these are probably the most useful upfront. - Best of luck.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzxuNoObmTzgrqsJNt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-15T21:16:40Z", "author": "casual anime", "text": "1:22:38", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzROPECwfaECTUxafB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-15T05:27:52Z", "author": "William Clark", "text": "\u2328\ufe0f (00:05) Introduction\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:37) What is Programming?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (06:19) How do we write Code?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (11:44) How do we get Information from Computers?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (14:46) What can Computers Do?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (20:43) What are Variables?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (25:02) How do we Manipulate Variables?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (31:54) What are Conditional Statements?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (37:54) What are Array\u2019s?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (44:26) What are Loops?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (49:37) What are Errors?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (55:22) How do we Debug Code?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:00:25) What are Functions?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:09:52) How can we Import Functions?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:13:45) How do we make our own Functions?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:21:56) What are ArrayLists and Dictionaries?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:27:38) How can we use Data Structures?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:36:27) What is Recursion?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:43:42) What is Pseudocode?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:50:40) Choosing the Right Language?\r\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:55:34) Applications of Programming", "likes": 586}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzROPECwfaECTUxafB4AaABAg.9dUra7ryFxh9hM7qLxmS-X", "publishedAt": "2022-10-19T06:11:02Z", "author": "Patty Flipper", "text": "this dude copy and pasted it straight from the description \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgzROPECwfaECTUxafB4AaABAg.9dUra7ryFxh9h1RTQVOu0A", "publishedAt": "2022-10-11T05:18:29Z", "author": "aditi", "text": "One like for this man's effort", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzROPECwfaECTUxafB4AaABAg.9dUra7ryFxh9fvtD9SsLIJ", "publishedAt": "2022-09-13T19:43:35Z", "author": "Abeerah Wahaj", "text": "@PegDye I surely not none of them can copy the description\nYou can try \ud83d\ude43", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzROPECwfaECTUxafB4AaABAg.9dUra7ryFxh9fvpgsICykq", "publishedAt": "2022-09-13T19:12:50Z", "author": "PegDye", "text": "@Abeerah Wahaj you can?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzROPECwfaECTUxafB4AaABAg.9dUra7ryFxh9fpc-kjIht6", "publishedAt": "2022-09-11T09:17:46Z", "author": "Abeerah Wahaj", "text": "@simple guy heheheh \nYou can't copy from YouTube description.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxpQ9950QBLwFZrmah4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-07-14T16:12:54Z", "author": "Issa", "text": "just finished.

A\r\ncomputer is not intelligent on it's own. Programming makes the computer\r\nintelligent. A computer is much like a human, we both need knowledge in order to\r\nperform various tasks. The computer becomes as smart as the human makes it.\r\nFilling a program with as much details as possible is in other words what should\r\nbe done, so that the computer may execute the wanted task flawlessly.\r\n- Programming is done through binaries (ones and zeros), but code writing has\r\nvarious languages. Codes are converted to binaries within the computer. Much like\r\na human learning a new language in order to speak to somebody from another\r\ncountry, a human must learn a coding language in order to \"speak\" to a computer.\r\n- Programming languages can be split into two main categories, \"low-level\" and\r\n\"high-level\". Where high-level programming languages are such as Python and Java,\r\nwhile \"low-level\" are such as Assembly or C. The lower level a language has, the\r\ncloser it is to pure binary code.

I've tried starting videos or free courses to learn python, but I'm always feeling like I don't know what the hell is going on and need to somehow cover even more basic stuff. It's like \"wait how does the computer know that the parenthesis means something, where are th 1s and 0s, how does this electric box even convert these sentences into English text, how does it know to put those pixels in that manner\" like I'm just always questioning basics I feel I missed out on\n\nI don't own a computer, I use my phone for everything, because I can't afford a $4000 editing or gaming computer despite always trying to save up for it, but I still am trying to learn code for the first time, and this video ABSOLUTELY was exactly what I needed. It covers all those hyper basic questions I had right away in the beginning. I could not feel more out of place by this challenge, videos about code talk about stuff I couldn't even conceive of like \"data structures\" or \"logic strings\" or something, and I have no clue what those even are, nor can I think of why I would ever use them.\n\nI wanna figure out how to make my computer help with basic video editing, like just recognizing my voice in a recording or even in a script, and finding pictures or clips relating to what I'm saying and automatically place those on the time-line on Adobe Premiere so it doesn't take literal months to make a single video.\n\nAlso I'd like to learn how to make those quick clicking bots people use to make fast stock and options trades or buy concert tickets or limited edition objects in a millisecond because no human is able to make those.\n\nWhen I started learning editing, the ideas I had about the creative things I could do grew out of nothing, like I literally couldn't have imagined some of the things I eventually did right at the start, the knowledge forged my creativity of what I could do because i knew what was possible. I am hopeful that learning code will have the same effect, it will help direct my creativity toward coming up with new ideas of what uses I could creatively have for code \n\nThis video is great, I'm literally below an absolute beginner, I feel like I'm below zero, like im a negative beginner because of confusion I've gotten while trying to learn, so this has ABSOLUTELY helped me and I am eternally grateful. I will surely come back to this many times as I go along.\n\nIf anyone sees this comment in a week, a month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, a year and a third, a year and a half, 2 years, 28 months, 3 years, literally any period of time in the future, PLEASE do me a favor and reply to ask how it's going. I give up on a lot of things or get discouraged or stop because I get disillusioned after real world experience and application, or get distracted and fully forget. So PLEASE if anyone sees this, check in on me, ask if I'm still learning coding or what I've used coding for. I want to hope when I'm 30 in 2 years I'll be a proficient coder and will have even become wealthier through my use of code, and that people on the internet learning alongside me will be kind enough to check in \n\nYesterday I learned what binary and hexadecimal is, but today is my first day starting learning computer science or code, whatever the important one is for basics.

Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.

BUT the information here seems inconsistent with everything else that I'm finding elsewhere online where the first integer refers to the row numbers on the left side and the second is the column numbers on the top.
