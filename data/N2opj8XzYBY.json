TY for this video! Question: Is it possible to add up two characters in the same cell?

I know I can split the cell at the \"/\" into two columns, however I'm really trying to avoid doing that. \n\nFor example, below data from cells A1:A5, I sold 6 products but it shows in 5 rows:\n1 @ $4.00\n1 @ $6.00\n1 @ $7.50\n1 @ $5.00 / 1 @ $5.00\n1 @ $4.00\n\nI've tried:\n=countif(A1:A5, \"*1 @*\")   /// does not count two \"1 @\" in cell A4, just counts one.\nAdding text \"1 @*\" in cell B1, then using =countif(A1:A5, B1)  /// does not work, I still get one. \n\nAnyone know how to do this or if this is possible?
