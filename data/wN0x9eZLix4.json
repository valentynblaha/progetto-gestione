Tercero te cuento que soy Java developer de Argentina pero vivo en Alemania actualmente y quiero moverme a audio programming con C++ y JUCE framework, para postularme en alguna de las companias que  se dedican a hacer los DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) como Pro Tools, Ableton, Cubase, Logic, etc. \n\nQuisiera saber en que orden podrias recomendarme algo asi como un \"Bootcamp\" para estudiar C++ y despues moverme a JUCE. Ya he hecho casi todo lo general de OOP en C++ (excepto Multithreading) para obtener mi primer trabajo como Junior C++ Developer in Audio Programming. I'm a little bit confused and sometimes I feel that I waste my time.

In a natural way, a programmer who needs to use a class does not need or is interested on the details or how that class is implemented, he/she just use it through out its shared members and that's all. The only advantage that I see in using interfaces is a better organization and consistency in the inter classes' methods to implement their owns versions.
