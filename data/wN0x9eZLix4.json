Saldina, one of the things about encapsulation that disturbs me is that I seem like a lot of extra for no real benefit. I understand that encapsulation is for the purpose of hiding information and functionality. But for what purpose? You said that those items that are declared private and protected can still be accessed from outside by means of the process that accesses them through public methods. To me it seems like an oxymoron. Meaning that it doesn't really protect or keep private any data at all. Can you clear up this paradox for me? FYI: Oh, it sounds to me that you are from Russia?

In a natural way, a programmer who needs to use a class does not need or is interested on the details or how that class is implemented, he/she just use it through out its shared members and that's all. The only advantage that I see in using interfaces is a better organization and consistency in the inter classes' methods to implement their owns versions.

The point of encapsulation is to prevent an invalid state as a result of a series of member function calls. The simplest example would be to have a dynamic array of int class with member functions like so:\n``` \nclass simpleArray{\n/*private members*/\npublic:\n    // inserts at the back\n    void push_back(int);\n\n    // removes last element\n    void pop_back();\n\n    // returns size\n    int get_size();\n\n    /*constructor, operator[], etc...*/\n};\n```\nIf we call our member functions in any order, as many times as we want, then check size, there has to be no way, such that the size is wrong ie.: size=/=min(0, (count_of_pushes - count_of_pops)) given the array was empty at the start of the test. \nset_size(size_t); would allow us to shoot ourselves in the knee, so we don't create it.", "likes": 4}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bedirhan AK\u00c7AY", "text": "Oto \u00e7eviri olursa biraz daha iyi anlar\u0131m.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Cat Man", "text": "Thanks for using the term Software Engineer, lots of yahoos out there today calling themselves \"programmers\".
