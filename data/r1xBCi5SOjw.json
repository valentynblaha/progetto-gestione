Thank you for the kind words. In order to create this video and my other videos like this I use After Effects combined with Davinci Resolve.\n\nAs for learning the skills needed for these videos I watched a few YouTube tutorials on After Effects to get an idea of how to do general things, and then just jumped into After Effects learning as I went. I never actually took any courses so I don't have any recommendations in that regard, but if you just look for a general tutorial on After Effects you should be able to get the basics down well enough to start making your own videos.\n\nIt really just takes a lot of patience and time to learn and get better at editing videos. I know for me I have been able to cut the time it takes for me to edit a video down from multiple days to only a few hours by just constantly practicing.\n\nHopefully that is enough information to answer your question.
