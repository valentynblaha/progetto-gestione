When we click on the <i> element inside the button , the code runs fine but when we click on the button it removes the whole task-container as the parent of parent of button is the task-container.\nso this ambiguity can be removed like this:\n\n\r\naddTask.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\r\n  let task = document.createElement(\"div\");\r\n  task.classList.add(\"task\");\r\n\r\n  let li = document.createElement(\"li\");\r\n  li.innerText = `${inputTask.value}`;\r\n  task.appendChild(li);\r\n\r\n  let checkButton = document.createElement(\"button\");\r\n\r\n  checkButton.classList.add(\"checkTask\");\r\n  task.appendChild(checkButton);\r\n\r\n  let deleteButton = document.createElement(\"button\");\r\n\r\n  deleteButton.classList.add(\"deleteTask\");\r\n  task.appendChild(deleteButton);\r\n\r\n  if (inputTask.value === \"\") {\r\n    alert(\"please Enter a task\");\r\n  } else {\r\n    taskContainer.appendChild(task);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  inputTask.value = \"\";\r\n\r\n  checkButton.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\r\n    checkButton.parentElement.style.textDecoration = \"line-through\";\r\n  });\r\n  deleteButton.addEventListener(\"click\", function (e) {\r\n    let target = e.target;\r\n    target.parentElement.remove();\r\n    console.log(target);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\nWell I just removed the  \".innerhtml\" line from both check box button and delete button and targeted only the parent of buttons which is task and not the parent of parent of which is task-container. It can be done in a more different way keeping the icons intact.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyN4kiBIReU71rhJt54AaABAg.9kowuvL07lK9lGF4whTYdA", "publishedAt": "2023-01-24T09:24:28Z", "author": "jhozef dummy", "text": "@Piyush Yadav really?
