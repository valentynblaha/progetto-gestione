{"video": {"id": "6E6XecoTRVo", "title": "Neural Networks with JavaScript - Full Course using Brain.js", "description": "This course gives you a practical introduction to building neural networks in the browser and in Node.js using the Brain.js JavaScript library. To complete the course\u2019s interactive challenges, simply head over to the Scrimba version: https://scrimba.com/g/gneuralnetworks\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fWhat you'll learn \u2b50\ufe0f\nBy the end of the course, you'll be able to solve a range of different problems using neural networks. The lectures does not dwell with much theory, but rather on how to code the networks. That means the course is suitable for anybody who knows JavaScript. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0fAbout Robert Plummer \u2b50\ufe0f\nRobert is the lead developer of the Brain.js library. He has a unique ability to explain complex concepts in a manner that everyone can understand. Feel free to reach out to Robert via Twitter if you have feedback, or simply want to thank him for creating this course.\n\nGood luck, and welcome to the exciting world of neural networks!\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fCourse Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:00:00) Course introduction\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:01:46) Our first neural net!\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:04:31) How they learn - Propagation\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:07:57) How they learn - Structure\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:10:09) How they learn - Layers\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:14:04) Working with objects!\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:21:52) Learning more than numbers\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:34:21) Example: Counter\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:44:10) Normalization\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:50:35) Example: Stock price predictor\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:56:06) Predicting multiple steps\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:57:43) Example: A recurrent neural network that learns math\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:03:56) Example: Number detector\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:09:41) Example: Writing a children's book\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:11:28) Example: Sentiment detection\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:13:50) RNN inputs and outputs\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:17:56) Example: Simple reinforcement learning\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:21:03) Example: Recommendation engine\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:26:02) Closing thoughts\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT1H32M7S", "likes": "2415", "views": "105889"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "jenny", "text": "can i use brain.js with an asp net project ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Christopher Kolodziejczyk", "text": "Thanks for this video.

(for example working with images or sounds)\nWith the data so massive we can't just type out every possible input and output in the script. There must be some way of saving it and processing it chunks as a time.\nSo we can store our training data in Javascript in the LocalStorage but the maximum of it is 10MB. Which is not big.\nEverytime a page loads the script will have to feed all of the data into the neural network and it trains so you waste time everytime the page loads waiting for the model to train. So It would be beneficial to save the model state, I tried saving the neural as JSON but it only saves the attributes though, the methods aren't available.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Obamas Cock", "text": "Not too familiar with machine learning but I think you could store it using some type of database like mysql and access it with node.js to use with brain.js possibly no clue though.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jay Wiz", "text": "Please tell me why the need to slice the scaled data?@ 51:30", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Esa G", "text": "sounds like Tony Stark", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "David's Insider Club", "text": "I love the technology but the tutorial was unwatchable.
