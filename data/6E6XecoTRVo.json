To complete the course\u2019s interactive challenges, simply head over to the Scrimba version: https://scrimba.com/g/gneuralnetworks\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fWhat you'll learn \u2b50\ufe0f\nBy the end of the course, you'll be able to solve a range of different problems using neural networks. The lectures does not dwell with much theory, but rather on how to code the networks. That means the course is suitable for anybody who knows JavaScript. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0fAbout Robert Plummer \u2b50\ufe0f\nRobert is the lead developer of the Brain.js library. He has a unique ability to explain complex concepts in a manner that everyone can understand.

Which is not big.\nEverytime a page loads the script will have to feed all of the data into the neural network and it trains so you waste time everytime the page loads waiting for the model to train.
