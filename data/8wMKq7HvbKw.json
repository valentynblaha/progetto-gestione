This course teaches how to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum Blockchain. We are going to build 5 Ethereum Dapps. For each of them, we will:\n- Develop smart contracts\n- Test smart contracts\n- Build a web frontend to interact with the smart contract\n\nThe course covers:\n- The architecture of Dapps\n- Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contract\n- Remix, the online IDE for Solidity\n- Truffle, the framework for Solidity smart contracts\n- Ganache, the local development Blockchain\n- Web3, the JS library to integrate a Dapp frontend\n- Metamask, the Ethereum wallet used by most Dapps (browser extension)\n- Deployment to public testnet (Ropsten) and mainnet, using Infura API\n\nRequirements:\n- NodeJS v10\n- Works on both Windows, Linux and Mac\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Code: https://github.com/jklepatch/eattheblocks/tree/master/dapp-30\n\nRegister to the FREE mini-course \"become a blockchain developer\" on eattheblocks.com to learn how to get a remote blockchain job making 100k.\n\nFor more tutorials on Ethereum Dapps, Solidity smart contracts, check out the EatTheBlocks channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/eattheblocks\n\nWhile this is a stand-alone course, it is part of Dapp 30, a course where we build 30 Ethereum Dapps so that you can learn Ethereum Dapps / Solidity AND build your portfolio to get a job as Blockchain developer: \nhttps://eattheblocks-pro.teachable.com/p/dapp-30\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\nDapp 1 - Simple smart contract\n\u2328\ufe0f 8:22: Smart contract: Intro to Solidity, Remix, Deploying contract on Remix\n\u2328\ufe0f 21:09: Tests - Introduction to Truffle and tests\n\u2328\ufe0f 32:03: Frontend - Architecture of Ethereum Dapp / integration with smart contract, ABI, intro to Web3\n\nDapp 2 - Helloworld\n\u2328\ufe0f 57:18: Smart contract - Solidity read-only functions, Interacting with functions in Remix\n\u2328\ufe0f 1:07:28: Tests - Testing a smart contract function with Truffle\n\u2328\ufe0f 1:12:33: Frontend - Interacting with a smart contract function from frontend, with Web3\n\nDapp 3 - Simple storage\n\u2328\ufe0f 1:24:00: Smart contract - Solidity functions that can modify smart contract data (in transaction)\n\u2328\ufe0f 1:41:53: Tests - Test (transaction) smart contract functions with Truffle\n\u2328\ufe0f 1:45:27: Frontend - Sending transactions from frontend, with Web3\n\nDapp 4 - Complex storage\n\u2328\ufe0f 2:04:05: Smart contract - Solidity Arrays (adding element, read single element, read all elements and get length) \n\u2328\ufe0f 2:14:37: Tests - Testing Solidity arrays with Truffle, introduction to the BN.js library to deal with Solidity numbers\n\u2328\ufe0f 2:26:54: Frontend - Using Webpack / ES6 for Dapp frontend, Intro to (new) Metamask and integration with frontend\n\nDapp 5 - Crud\n\u2328\ufe0f 3:06:51: Smart contract - create, read update and delete data in Solidity\n\u2328\ufe0f 3:31:33: Tests - How to tests Solidity errors with Truffle (require, revert...)\n\u2328\ufe0f 3:47:25: Frontend - Deployment on public testnet (Ropsten) and Mainnet with Infura\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT4H49M4S", "likes": "4216", "views": "149488"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "humayun kabir", "text": "npm install -D truffle-hdwallet-provider failing in my case at 4:22", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Samyar", "text": "Well honestly, truffle part was complicated, and I didn't understand anything.

I understood more about eth watching this than I ever would watching  vids about using eth. It helps to know how and why stuff works and is used.  I was good with btc and its blockchain, but eth has so many apps for so much development with it that even finding out where one thing started and the next ended was melting my head.  What was just for eth, what was for contracts, and dev, and even working out if I should run a node or not to be happy with what wallets.  Urgghhh...  I had to learn the btc blockchain api to understand it properly, so I knew how it was secure, and I needed something like that for eth and contracts. As a programmer, it's how I need to learn, by understanding the processes. Simple, but seeing the simplicity within such a mess of stuff for eth was too much.
