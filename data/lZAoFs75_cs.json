Then you spending time teaching commands today a 12 year old knows. And what is hacking that is so interesting to people. This is not something you can go learn this is something that you can and should and can if you have the interest to do it. The most important thing is to do it not sit and be amazed by the tools that are shown because everything that relates to hacking is boring to people who seeks as a learning based but its eye opening to people who feeds of breaking things feeds of taking apart and re-engineering. Those who interest in learning hacking will always only know what is shown to them but that is if the very tools they learnws know how to utilize them. But very few i have seen take the knowledge and made it their day and night type of thing and that is determination who do not need anyone to teach them. Take a computer and take it apart put it back together then do it again and again and again. I promise you by the time you do this 10X or 20X or more you are ready to put every tool to work and actually do it because if you sit and learn by watching you will never learn nothing and stop this trying to teach in the name of hacking and you teaching what a 12 year old can do. You are an embarrassment to psycho hackers community. I broke into windows computer when i was 12 and these commands this guy is teaching been on youtube fo past 20 years where people keep showing over and over. This is an embarrassment garbage if you thinking this is where you begin on your path to break systems or monitor system behaviors or find potential break throughs.

They can do that themselves. Or in our cases we build them in the CI/CD pipeline to catch the obvious code issues that these tools also check for during the CI process. And when those are triggered there won\u2019t be a release build so the potentially exploitabel code cannot even be released.\nAnd a good company has their own Linter team that writes Lints for their code stack.\n\nBecause usually the security problem lies a lot deeper, such as in code (even zero days as recently OpenSSL (again) and privilege access management and the required interoperability with other systems, teams or worse over the internet clients/businesses.\nRights structures on the cloud are incredibly complex these days and having a infrastructure as code solution with least privileged approach everything over private endpoints no public access enabled. Only access to your middleware and back end over mutual certificate authentication. And very strict oauth2 and eidm for the public side. With inspection.

the directory x even if x and I are not in the same place\r\n           example:cd /asd/x\r\n               (you have to put a slash at the front since it is the absolute 1st directory)\r\n\r\n   ls x/\r\n       used to check what is in the directory x(only works if x and I are in the same directory)\r\n   ls -la\r\n       ls -list all,used to see all directories in my current directories(even the once which are hidden in just the ls command)\r\n       can be used to ssee permission settings for the stuffs in the directory\r\n\r\ncd x/\r\n    used to enter the directory named x in our current directory\r\n        the terminal can autofill the name if the folder\r\n   cd (directory of x)\r\n       used to enter the directory named x even if x and I are not in the same directory\r\n           example:cd /asd/x/\r\n\r\n   cd (some letters)\r\n       this will show the directories that start with those letters(you have to click tab once or maybe twice for this)\r\n\r\n   cd /saev/wev/wev/x can be replaced with cd -/x/   ( (-) represents the home page or the root page and does not require / before it)\r\n\r\nmkdir (the word you want to name your directory)\r\n    make directory, used to create a new directory in your current directory\r\n\r\nrmdir (the name of the directory)/\r\n    remove directory, used to remove a directory\r\n\r\n   rm (the file with it's

Downloads/ (note: the location has to be present in our current directory)\r\n\r\nmv (file name with format) (location)/\r\n    move file to somewhere, works like cp (file name with format) (location)/ but instead of copying,you cut\r\n\r\nlocate (file name)\r\n    no need to say the use since it is obvious\r\n\r\nupdatedb\r\n    update database\r\n\r\npasswd\r\n    password, used to

work as always by TCM. To improve this video, it would be nice to be able to jump directly to the chapters. When in the terminal, it would be nice to enlarge the font size. And after I download Kali 2021.3, which was the latest version, I was surprised at the number of tools I needed to update. When I tried updating everything, which was recommended, while running apt-update && apt-upgrade I got a scary error msg stating the GRUB Boot Loader that was previously installed to a disk is no longer present or whose unique identifier has been changed for some reason...  I wasn't sure if this screwed up my VirtualBox machine or my real machine or didn't do anything at all, so I CTRL+C out of it. Fortunately, nothing appears to be damaged.

If the title was \"An introduction to Linux, using the Kali distro\" then I think it would be much better because there is very little here about hacking. The most relevant part is the 'additional resources/bonus material' which is just the last 10 mins, and most of which points to other websites.\nBut even then, the coverage was very uneven (like the sound volume, another problem). For example, some of the most basic topics were covered in depth (fine if you're targeting beginners), but then other more useful topics were skipped over as if you think people already understand them. And I lost count of how many times you said \"we'll talk about that later\" (or similar) but you never covered it. \nMy advice (which of course you can ignore if you want):\n- Decide who your target audience is ... beginners/intermediate/advanced ... general linux users/newbie pen testers/advanced pen testers?\n- Plan your content according to the target audience. You've got lots of good stuff, but it's all over the place\n- Re-title the video!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugxj2xP1An3Kn-bIqRx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-21T20:48:34Z", "author": "Bruno Menezes", "text": "Ok so my virtual machine shows its own IP (10.x.y.z) instead of my public IP.

I lost my job few months back after my divorce with my wife. I tried everything positive to make sure i take good care of my kids but all failed, and i was in debts which makes everything worse. I was kicked out of my home and i had to live with my neighbor after pleading with her to allow me stay with her for some days while i figure out how to get a home which she agreed, but no one was willing to help anymore. I bumped into this page from google and I was excited about this, then I contacted the hackers. I had just $200, so I pleaded with them to help me because of my condition but they never accepted. I believed in this, so I managed to a pawn a few things and got $500. I ordered the $10,000 card and I got my card delivered to me by Ups 4 days later. I never believed my eyes! I was excited and upset as well, I managed to withdraw $2000 on the ATM and $2500 the second day. I went to Walmart and a grocery and bought a couple of things for $3000. The card got blocked the third day and I contacted them and I was told its a mistake from my end. I\u2019m so happy, I have started all over again and have a good apartment with my kids you can contact him through is via email (smartcashmoneyback.com)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzSMLE3eEfpJIoXnH54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-11T04:26:34Z", "author": "Will Smith", "text": "\u79c1\u306f\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u5bdb\u5927\u306a\u4eba\u751f\u306b\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u5727\u5012\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u8ab0\u304b\u304c\u3068\u3066\u3082\u826f\u3044\u306e\u304b\u7406\u89e3\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u79c1\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4fe1\u4ef0\u3092\u5931\u3063\u305f\u6642\u306bSmartcashmoneyback.com\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u3066\u304f\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u305d\u308c\u306f\u79c1\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u5927\u304d\u306a\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u305f\u3060\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u611f\u8b1d\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzSMLE3eEfpJIoXnH54AaABAg.9FuTsZUimBF9FwhflTBdGw", "publishedAt": "2020-11-12T01:14:22Z", "author": "\ud83c\udd7elycka \u00ae    ", "text": "spam", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxTch45CWrPu4Bumu94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-11T04:25:16Z", "author": "Lucy Hale", "text": "Pomwe ndimaganiza kuti njira zanga zonse zatsekedwa Mudabwera ndi kundiwonetsa njira ya moyo smartcashmoneyback .com Mwa tanthauzo lonse lomwe limasinthiratu Ndipo pamatanthawuzo onse azopereka Mudakhalapo ndipo zikutanthauza zambiri kwa ine Kudzera pakuthandizira kwanu  , zinthu zambiri ndimatha kuziwona Ndikuthokoza kochokera pansi pamtima kuchokera kwa ine pazinthu zonse Zabwino Kwambiri Zikomo", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyPkxBYytq3Kldob0x4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-11T04:17:55Z", "author": "dq dq", "text": "Can I use this things on Ubuntu?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxXoV4W7wso276W-ld4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-10T21:02:02Z", "author": "TyreeRockets", "text": "So insightful!!!

There are many good Kali videos but Kali has been around so long that old content loses relevance sometimes... Procedures, tools and requirements change over time.\nCovers a number of very basic maintenance and a very elementary scripting that can automate tasks.\n\nMinuses:\nThe presentation content is very weak on proper terminology and definition or depth often. Nothing I've noticed where things don't work, but it's never too early to learn things as \"properly\" as possible so that things don't have to be re-learned or unlearned later.\nNot knowing how to pronounce terminology correctly, like SEE-QUEL(alternatively spelling out the letters SQL), POST-GREZ-SEE-QUEL, SYSTEMCONTROL and mixing legacy commands like \"service apache2\" when you should change entirely to the new \"systemctl\" commands.\nWhen installing in a Virtualization technology, you should install Guest enhancements (VMware Tools or Virtualbox Guest Additions) which at this time is not already installed in the Guest image. There also are various highly recommended settings in the HostOS part of the virtualization besides the most essential that are described.\nWhy things are done a certain way at times, eg why a person might want to install Veil from github source instead of the Debian packages.\nRegarding the scripting specifically, I'd recommend defining your target audience in detail. Because this video is obviously targeted to the person very unfamiliar with scripting, IMO every part of the scripting should have been described which were skipped over like the use of variable.\n\nBottom line,\nThe content is on the level of a noob which I wouldn't really criticize because everyone starts somewhere.\nBut, I'd ask that the content be prepared a bit better to elevate from \"OK\" to \"I'd recommend.\" The numerous small inaccuracies which don't seem important immediately are nevertheless not helpful as the viewer advances in knowledge.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyKAXG1uFIm2H6BRTB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-06-08T14:52:43Z", "author": "Japhet Kiplagat", "text": "am a beginer only done icdl help me need to teach me this course", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzBcghbA8WAwUweB8F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-06-07T17:50:28Z", "author": "Jaco van der Merwe", "text": "i got this error - \"Error while powering on: This host does not support virtualizing real mode.
