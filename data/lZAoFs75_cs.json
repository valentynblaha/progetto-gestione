They can do that themselves. Or in our cases we build them in the CI/CD pipeline to catch the obvious code issues that these tools also check for during the CI process. And when those are triggered there won\u2019t be a release build so the potentially exploitabel code cannot even be released.\nAnd a good company has their own Linter team that writes Lints for their code stack.\n\nBecause usually the security problem lies a lot deeper, such as in code (even zero days as recently OpenSSL (again) and privilege access management and the required interoperability with other systems, teams or worse over the internet clients/businesses.\nRights structures on the cloud are incredibly complex these days and having a infrastructure as code solution with least privileged approach everything over private endpoints no public access enabled. Only access to your middleware and back end over mutual certificate authentication. And very strict oauth2 and eidm for the public side. With inspection. But that sort of thing I hardly see any security \u201cexpert\u201d talk about or actually know about.\n\nWe all can run standard tools that others made. But 99% of these \u201cwhite hats\u201d, couldn\u2019t even write proper code themselves.

Women cheat as much as men do.  If you're suspecting your wife of infidelity, you'll have to keep an eye on her of her without her knowledge of her.  One of the best ways to know if your spouse cheats on social platforms is by paying close attention to how your spouse behaves while online.  The signs are pretty the same.  Is your spouse more time on the app without explanation and gets unnecessarily defensive when you ask about it?  If your spouse behavior has changed lately, and continues to spend more time on social apps, it's time for you to take action, with the help of a private investigator (suggested; ExploitByte.Net, you can find out what is taking all their time on social apps, who they are talking to and other things happening", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "AlE GrIn", "text": "My wife never trust hackers,-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- but we had some issues with her friend and they had put her in some issues with the feds she knew nothing about the things and the only proof we had was a chat on her Facebook messenger which she had already deleted , I went online to find ways to recover a deleted message and we came across so many reviews for exploitbyte net, on google We did contact them to help us with the service and they did after we made payment , we were kind of sceptical that it may not work but it was a smooth service", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Football World 99", "text": "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for this great and educative video.

If the title was \"An introduction to Linux, using the Kali distro\" then I think it would be much better because there is very little here about hacking. The most relevant part is the 'additional resources/bonus material' which is just the last 10 mins, and most of which points to other websites.\nBut even then, the coverage was very uneven (like the sound volume, another problem). For example, some of the most basic topics were covered in depth (fine if you're targeting beginners), but then other more useful topics were skipped over as if you think people already understand them. And I lost count of how many times you said \"we'll talk about that later\" (or similar) but you never covered it. \nMy advice (which of course you can ignore if you want):\n- Decide who your target audience is ... beginners/intermediate/advanced ... general linux users/newbie pen testers/advanced pen testers?\n- Plan your content according to the target audience.

I lost my job few months back after my divorce with my wife. I tried everything positive to make sure i take good care of my kids but all failed, and i was in debts which makes everything worse. I was kicked out of my home and i had to live with my neighbor after pleading with her to allow me stay with her for some days while i figure out how to get a home which she agreed, but no one was willing to help anymore. I bumped into this page from google and I was excited about this, then I contacted the hackers. I had just $200, so I pleaded with them to help me because of my condition but they never accepted. I believed in this, so I managed to a pawn a few things and got $500. I ordered the $10,000 card and I got my card delivered to me by Ups 4 days later. I never believed my eyes! I was excited and upset as well, I managed to withdraw $2000 on the ATM and $2500 the second day. I went to Walmart and a grocery and bought a couple of things for $3000. The card got blocked the third day and I contacted them and I was told its a mistake from my end.

There are many good Kali videos but Kali has been around so long that old content loses relevance sometimes... Procedures, tools and requirements change over time.\nCovers a number of very basic maintenance and a very elementary scripting that can automate tasks.\n\nMinuses:\nThe presentation content is very weak on proper terminology and definition or depth often. Nothing I've noticed where things don't work, but it's never too early to learn things as \"properly\" as possible so that things don't have to be re-learned or unlearned later.\nNot knowing how to pronounce terminology correctly, like SEE-QUEL(alternatively spelling out the letters SQL), POST-GREZ-SEE-QUEL, SYSTEMCONTROL and mixing legacy commands like \"service apache2\" when you should change entirely to the new \"systemctl\" commands.\nWhen installing in a Virtualization technology, you should install Guest enhancements (VMware Tools or Virtualbox Guest Additions) which at this time is not already installed in the Guest image. There also are various highly recommended settings in the HostOS part of the virtualization besides the most essential that are described.\nWhy things are done a certain way at times, eg why a person might want to install Veil from github source instead of the Debian packages.\nRegarding the scripting specifically, I'd recommend defining your target audience in detail. Because this video is obviously targeted to the person very unfamiliar with scripting, IMO every part of the scripting should have been described which were skipped over like the use of variable.\n\nBottom line,\nThe content is on the level of a noob which I wouldn't really criticize because everyone starts somewhere.\nBut, I'd ask that the content be prepared a bit better to elevate from \"OK\" to \"I'd recommend.\" The numerous small inaccuracies which don't seem important immediately are nevertheless not helpful as the viewer advances in knowledge.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Japhet Kiplagat", "text": "am a beginer only done icdl help me need to teach me this course", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jaco van der Merwe", "text": "i got this error - \"Error while powering on: This host does not support virtualizing real mode.
