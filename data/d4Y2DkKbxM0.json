(C++, NodeJs, whatever) if I want to login, then will the bcrypt from another language result to the same result?\n\nThanks for this amazing work!\n\nMax", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Brandon McCann", "text": "\u201cYou can watch other tutorials\u2026\u201d love this!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "sparta", "text": "what is ur IDE plz", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ahmed Krd\u017eali\u0107", "text": "what IDE was used in the video??", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Supriyo", "text": "@Ahmed Krd\u017eali\u0107 Thanks", "likes": 1}, {"author": "Ahmed Krd\u017eali\u0107", "text": "I found it, it is GoLand.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Pablo C.
