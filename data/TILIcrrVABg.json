From editing, to linting, to debugging and more, you will learn how to get started, as well as tips and tricks to save you time in your everyday development lifecycle.\n\nIf you\u2019re an experienced Python developer, you will learn how to take advantage of all of Visual Studio Code\u2019s capabilities to maximize your productivity. If you\u2019re a new Python developer, you will learn more about Python and how to use Visual Studio Code to get up and running quickly.\n\nWe will start by showing how to create a new application, configure linting, manage virtual environments, and run code. Then we\u2019ll show how to use more powerful features like debugging, unit testing and Visual Studio Live Share for collaborative editing and debugging with your co-workers. Finally, we\u2019ll show how you can install additional extensions to set up your keyboard bindings, manage docker containers, deploy to the cloud, and more!\n\nTalk given by Dan Taylor at EuroPython conference 2018.
