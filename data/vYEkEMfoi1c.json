Just finished it up. \nA question: Is there a way to disable to other button in the question upon clicking one? although cheating isn't really possible since the score is subtracted upon clicking a wrong answer,(and clicking the right one after would just negate it) there is always the possibility of the reverse: the user clicking the right one first then misclicking the wrong one.\nI think it'd be better if the other button could be disabled outright after choosing one and not have to rely on score subtraction. Is there a way to do this with the way the project currently is set up?
