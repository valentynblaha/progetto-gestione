Learn all about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in this full tutorial for beginners. You will learn what APIs do, why APIs exist, and the many benefits of APIs. APIs are used all the time in programming and web development so it is important to understand how to use them.\n\nYou will also get hands-on experience with a few popular web APIs. As long as you know the absolute basics of coding and the web, you'll have no problem following along.\n\nThis course has been updated from a previous version.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Teacher\u2019s Notes: https://twil.io/notes-api-course\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created by Craig Dennis, Developer Educator at Twilio\n\ud83d\udc26 Craig on Twitter: @craigsdennis\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\nUnit 1 - What is an API\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 1 - Welcome (0:00:00)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 2 - Defining Interface (0:04:50)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 3 - Defining API (0:08:49)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 4 - Remote APIs (0:13:59)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 5 - How the web works (0:18:17)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 6 - RESTful API Constraint Scavenger Hunt (0:23:21)\n\nUnit 2 - Exploring APIs\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 1 - Exploring an API online (0:29:06)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 2 - Using an API from the command line  (0:45:01)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 3 - You go Curl (0:56:20)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 4 - Using tools to explore APIs (1:14:21)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 5 - More tools for your API exploring toolbox (1:36:20)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 6 - Using Helper Libraries (1:48:34)\n\nUnit 3 - All Together Now\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 1 - Introducing the Project (2:15:30)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 2 - Serverless (2:23:30)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 3 - Writing a Server Side API (2:37:08)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 4 - Fetching Results on the Client from our Server (2:56:54)\n\u2328\ufe0f Video 5 - Wrap Up (3:05:29)\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\n\ud83d\udc7e Nattira Maneerat\n\ud83d\udc7e Heather Wcislo\n\ud83d\udc7e Serhiy Kalinets\n\ud83d\udc7e Erdeniz Unvan\n\ud83d\udc7e Justin Hual\n\ud83d\udc7e Agust\u00edn Kussrow\n\ud83d\udc7e Otis Morgan\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT3H7M7S", "likes": "3892", "views": "69966"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwyMhZvsntXKA7hRWJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-02-10T18:30:41Z", "author": "pakidude89", "text": "2 minutes into the course and already 'I'm Lovin It'", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzhrBYopGj55quGWkh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-02-10T11:44:57Z", "author": "Horatiu Oltean", "text": "i can't belive i just saw this video for free. you guys are incredible", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxfgtGJVqTlnWI_6OJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-02-09T20:58:36Z", "author": "Jonathan Burr", "text": "For Unit 3 - if opening the .html example code shows nothing - you need to download the plug-in as well using package downloader npm for SilentBox - links are in course notes.

For example:\n10:14 : Craig talking about *JS API* here: by calling one of the JS API - toUpperCase() function to turn a string to uppercase. So we don't have to worry about how it works under the hood. It hides away the abstraction. We just call this method and voila, the string turns to uppercase!\n12:16 : Frameworks provide API that allows you to extend what has been provided to make it your own. Again, you don't need to know how it works but you do need to know how to implement it. Just like, we need to know how to call toUpperCase() function to turn a string to uppercase. Framework often comes with certain rules you need to comply with, like Express- requesting/importing certain things to add routes.\n13:33 : What is the API Craig's hinting about? Youtube API?
