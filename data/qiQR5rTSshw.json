Em v\u00e1rios momentos da vida, todos passamos por momentos em que necessitamos de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o urgente. Quando parece que aquela solu\u00e7\u00e3o da qual tanto precisamos fica emperrada, amarrada, recorremos a Santo Expedito como intercessor junto de Deus. E milh\u00f5es de pessoas ao redor do mundo j\u00e1 experimentaram a poderosa intercess\u00e3o deste santo, vendo resolvidas suas causas mais urgentes e aflitivas.\n\nPor\u00e9m, para melhor vivermos a devo\u00e7\u00e3o a Santo Expedito, \u00e9 preciso compreendermos porque ele se tornou o Padroeiro das Causas Urgentes. Este conhecimento, certamente, vai nos levar a uma devo\u00e7\u00e3o mais fervorosa a este grande santo da Igreja.\n\nA \u201curg\u00eancia das causas\u201d est\u00e1 ligada \u00e0 vida de Santo Expedito. Ele era um alto oficial do ex\u00e9rcito romano, senador e comandante da XII Legi\u00e3o romana que atuava na Arm\u00eania. Ele comandou esta Legi\u00e3o entre os anos 296 a 303 d. C. E, mesmo ocupando posi\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e3o elevada, entrou em contato com os crist\u00e3os e simpatizou-se com f\u00e9 em Jesus Cristo, mas relutava em se converter de verdade.\n\nSua alta posi\u00e7\u00e3o social e militar lhe proporcionavam uma vida cheia de luxos e prazeres de todo tipo. De tal forma que, mesmo estando aberto ao cristianismo, ele adiava seu batismo e sua convers\u00e3o sincera. Ele tinha o v\u00edcio da procrastina\u00e7\u00e3o, aquele mau h\u00e1bito de \u201cdeixar para depois\u201d aquilo que \u00e9 urgente fazer agora.\n\nExpedito era um grande l\u00edder no comando da XII Legi\u00e3o tanto na paz quanto na guerra. Acumulava vit\u00f3rias e gl\u00f3rias na carreira militar. Por\u00e9m, espiritualmente, deixava sua convers\u00e3o para depois. Ele percebia que, na verdade, isso era o mais urgente em sua vida, mas parecia n\u00e3o ter for\u00e7as para tomar uma decis\u00e3o firme.\n\nEnt\u00e3o, certa noite, ele teve um sonho. Sonhou que estava diante de um corvo que, no ch\u00e3o, grasnava forte a palavra \u201ccras\u201d, em Latim, amanh\u00e3. Nesse momento, ele pisou no corvo, empunhou e levantou um crucifixo no qual estava escrito \u201chodie\u201d, que significa hoje. Acordando, compreendeu imediatamente o significado do sonho. O corvo simbolizava o esp\u00edrito maligno que lhe gritava \u201cdeixe sua convers\u00e3o para amanh\u00e3\u201d. Mas a for\u00e7a do Esp\u00edrito Santo lhe dizia: \u201cconverta-se hoje\u201d.\n\nSanto Expedito compreendeu a mensagem e, no mesmo dia, procurou os crist\u00e3os, pediu o batismo e se converteu verdadeiramente. Por isso, ele \u00e9 chamado o \u201cSanto das Causas Urgentes\u201d. H\u00e1, ainda, mais dois motivos para ele ter esse t\u00edtulo: o primeiro \u00e9 o significado do seu nome. Expedito significa aquele que cumpre tarefas ou resolve problemas com rapidez, agilidade e efici\u00eancia. O segundo motivo \u00e9 porque, no comando da XII Legi\u00e3o Romana, ele tinha que ser decidido, \u00e1gil, r\u00e1pido, \u201cexpedito\u201d.\n\nA convers\u00e3o de Expedito levou \u00e0 convers\u00e3o muitos de sua tropa. Por isso, o imperador Diocleciano o perseguiu, bem como a seus soldados. Prendeu-o e exigiu que ele renegasse sua f\u00e9. Mas Expedito se recusou. Preferiu morrer a negar Jesus Cristo. Por isso, foi flagelado e, depois, decapitado no dia 19 de abril de 303, em Melitene na Arm\u00eania. Sua coragem levou \u00e0 convers\u00e3o de milhares de pessoas na regi\u00e3o.\n\nPor sua hist\u00f3ria de vida e testemunho de f\u00e9, a devo\u00e7\u00e3o a Santo Expedito \u00e9 a devo\u00e7\u00e3o da coragem, da decis\u00e3o de seguir Jesus. \u00c9 a devo\u00e7\u00e3o da confian\u00e7a no seu poder de intercess\u00e3o junto a Jesus, em nosso favor, pelas causas urgentes de nossa vida. Confiemos em Santo Expedito nas causas urgentes. Deus delegou a ele esta miss\u00e3o de intercess\u00e3o.\n\nA Poderosa Ora\u00e7\u00e3o de Santo Expedito\n\u201cMeu Santo Expedito das Causas Justas e Urgentes.\nSocorrei-me nesta hora de afli\u00e7\u00e3o e desespero, interceda por mim junto ao Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo.\nV\u00f3s que sois um Santo guerreiro.\nV\u00f3s que sois o Santo dos aflitos.\nV\u00f3s que sois o Santo dos desesperados.\nV\u00f3s que sois o Santo das causas urgentes.\nProtegei-me.

Even for entry level network engineers it takes more than this.  Used to be that getting Cisco's CCNA would get you the entry level network engineer position (or higher).  Although I will say that the Cisco exams are some of the hardest that I have taken (but that might have changed since the last time I took them).
