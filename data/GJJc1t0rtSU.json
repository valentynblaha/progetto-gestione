This process can be applied to any deep learning paper, not just deep reinforcement learning.\n\nIn the second part, you will learn how to code a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent using Python and PyTorch, to beat the continuous lunar lander environment (a classic machine learning problem).\n\nDDPG combines the best of Deep Q Learning and Actor Critic Methods into an algorithm that can solve environments with continuous action spaces. We will have an actor network that learns the (deterministic) policy, coupled with a critic network to learn the action-value functions. We will make use of a replay buffer to maximize sample efficiency, as well as target networks to assist in algorithm convergence and stability.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created by Phil Tabor.

Is it possible to have a question and answer system with natural language that can understand the progression of time. 2 pieces of information had a relationship in the past but now they are not related and the system refrain on the actual question to mix the past information with the new one.
