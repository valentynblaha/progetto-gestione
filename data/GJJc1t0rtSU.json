{"video": {"id": "GJJc1t0rtSU", "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning in Python Tutorial - A Course on How to Implement Deep Learning Papers", "description": "In this intermediate deep learning tutorial, you will learn how to go from reading a paper on deep deterministic policy gradients to implementing the concepts in Tensorflow. This process can be applied to any deep learning paper, not just deep reinforcement learning.\n\nIn the second part, you will learn how to code a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent using Python and PyTorch, to beat the continuous lunar lander environment (a classic machine learning problem).\n\nDDPG combines the best of Deep Q Learning and Actor Critic Methods into an algorithm that can solve environments with continuous action spaces. We will have an actor network that learns the (deterministic) policy, coupled with a critic network to learn the action-value functions. We will make use of a replay buffer to maximize sample efficiency, as well as target networks to assist in algorithm convergence and stability.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Course created by Phil Tabor.

This being said I would like to know just a simple question to justify if i jump in the world of ML. The problem is the development of question answer system. Think in a project with many disciplines with 200-300 people where the information is dynamic spread in many documents and wiki's and the data change along the time. Is it possible to have a question and answer system with natural language that can understand the progression of time. 2 pieces of information had a relationship in the past but now they are not related and the system refrain on the actual question to mix the past information with the new one. The system can show how the question changed along time but not infer relationships of past events with actual ones.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Sai Srinivas Murthy Narayanam", "text": "using the code piece state = state[np.newaxis,:] is giving an error ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (3,) for Tensor TargetActor_9/inputs:0, which has shape (None, 3)\ncan anyone help me with this ?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Chris OA", "text": "yea man...im in some super deep rabbit hole of programming videos while eating candy.
