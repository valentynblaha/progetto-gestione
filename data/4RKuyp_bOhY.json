In order to integrate React with a .NET Web API component we utilise the 'ASP.NET Core with React.js' project template from within the free version of Visual Studio 2022 (the community edition).\n\nThe App that we build enables users to rank items by dragging and dropping the items (displayed in a list) to a cell position on the ranking grid (the grid is positioned above the list of relevant items). Each cell position on the grid denotes a ranking value for e.g. the top left cell is position number 1, denoting the top ranked item, the cell positioned to the immediate right of this cell denotes the 2nd ranked item and so on...the bottom right cell denotes the worst possible ranking position. So this is a fun app to code that will give a learner an insight into how to build a simple app using React on the front-end that leverages a .NET Web API component on the backend.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Code: https://github.com/GavinLonDigital/RankingApp\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Gavin Lon created this tutorial.
