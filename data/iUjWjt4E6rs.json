These meetings are a short, helpful, and necessary part of the day for many developers.\n\nA lot of new devs wonder what web developers do on a day-to-day basis. In this video, you will learn all about the Daily Stand Up meeting, which is common in many development jobs. You will also learn tips to help you through your first DSU. \n\nVideo by Anissa Deanna.\n\ud83c\udfa5Anissa's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVOKt2XgozvMSnZDZGMdetg\n\ud83d\udcf7Anissa on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/anissadeanna/\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT3M59S", "likes": "546", "views": "15103"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwP7DtN3KSCvlrl2IJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-09-24T18:02:23Z", "author": "Black Clover", "text": "Doing the standup is the most ridiculous thing companies do!

For me it works. I'm on a team of 3-4 ppl including my ITPM and sometimes the 508 guy or someone from dev ops. It really just helps keep us on top of priority stuff. We don't talk to the business, so it allows us to hear if we are on the right track or get updates. Now a days, it usually last less than 10 minutes which is nice. With bigger groups it was a pain, at one point they combined a bunch of devs working on different apps into one DSU and it wasn't helpful and lasted closer 20minutes. I work from home, so a lot of the time I was working on my own stuff and just listening for keywords or my name in the DSU convo. I think its value depends on the situation and it's up to the ITPM to make sure it works for the team.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwP7DtN3KSCvlrl2IJ4AaABAg.8la4-DDttXc8ll1cjEDYr0", "publishedAt": "2018-09-29T00:13:21Z", "author": "Daniel Martz", "text": "Black Clover I\u2019ve never stood while doing it, and yet we call it a stand up because that\u2019s the common name for this sort of meeting.

I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called \u201cFischer Random Chess,\u201d where the starting position of the pieces is \u201crandomized\u201d to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0\r\n\r\nBIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz-gNXCmztq_v33K014AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-27T18:20:35Z", "author": "Bhushan Jungala", "text": "Never thought, I would ever find a video to explain this torture concept in almost every IT organization. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgykUdyZ5PWEkj6vkIN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-08-11T22:22:08Z", "author": "tyler Knight", "text": "0:32", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzbsPg9NswzL8b4Cmh4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-01T16:50:45Z", "author": "Rahul Maheta", "text": "How can i start dsu , i am project manager but I can't find out proper way to start dsu and takes it as regular practice.
