{"video": {"id": "3LWgbjVWLug", "title": "WebAssembly and the Death of JavaScript", "description": "For more than 20 years JavaScript has been the only 'native' language of the web. That's all changed with the release of WebAssembly. This talk will look at what WebAssembly is, why it matters and crucially what it means for JavaScript and the future of web development. JavaScript brought interactivity to the web more than 20 years ago, and despite numerous challengers, it is still the only language supported by browser. However, as those 20 years have passed we've moved from adding a little interactivity to largely static sites, to creating complex JavaScript-heavy single page applications. Throughout this journey, the way we use JavaScript itself has also changed. Gone are the days of writing simple code snippets that are run directly in the browser. Nowadays we transpile, minify, tree-shake and more, treating the JavaScript virtual machine as a compilation target.\n\nThe problem is, JavaScript isn't a very good compilation target, because it simply wasn't designed to be one.\n\nBorn out of asm.js, a somewhat crazy concept dreamt up by Mozilla, WebAssembly was designed from the ground-up as an efficient compilation target for the web. It promises smaller payloads, rapid parsing and validation and consistent performance ... and it's ready to use, right now!\n\nThis talk will look at what's wrong with the way we are using JavaScript today and why we need WebAssembly. It will delve into the internals, giving a quick tour of the WebAssembly instruction set, memory and security model, before moving on to the more practical aspects of using it with Rust, C++ and JavaScript. Finally we'll do some crystal-ball gazing and see what the future of this rapidly evolving technology might hold.\n\nTalk by Colin Eberhardt at the JS Monthly London Meetup.\n\nRecorded by Pusher.com.\n\nPusher's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoyqucxoFXDFnh3khD0rjUg\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org", "duration": "PT40M6S", "likes": "1366", "views": "101203"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"author": "Monocycle-ing Linguiste", "text": "Web Assembly is definitely relevant here at the end of 2020, but JS is nowhere close to kicking the bucket.
