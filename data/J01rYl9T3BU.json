I also managed to connect to Postgres DB using psql to verify the updates worked. That was exciting progress.\n\nAfter 1.5 months (now) - I have just came across the term 'PERN Stack'. \n\nNow if day 1, I was sent to this tutorial, with none of the previous context, I believe I'd have gotten off to a speedier start. 'PERN Stack' was the magic word(s) I was looking for.\n\nHonestly, even if it seems crazy to experienced devs, as a newbie I would love to make a basic database with one table; ID, name. I want to display it on a living breathing website. Then I want to create front end buttons to add/delete rows from it. I really want to sprint toward this goal, with my eyes closed.
