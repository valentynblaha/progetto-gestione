If they \"liked me\" so much why don't they ever contact me back for the final interview?\n\nNot to sound sexist or mean, but you mean to tell me that someone hired this young lady with no experience, no work ethic and no skills and she still got to keep her job?\n\nSorry but this is an insult to hard working people that can't even get their foot in the door because of some other factor that has nothing to do with coding skills. \n\nI just don't get it.
