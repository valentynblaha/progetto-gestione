They have a start and an end point. With vanilla JS you might just make an array containing all the numbers in the range, but that will take up a lot of memory. The better way would be to define an iterator symbol that yields the next number and then immediately frees the memory. This way you'll only be storing a maximum of 3 numbers (start, end, current), instead of, lets say, a billion.\nBut what if I do something like `50000 in new NumberRange(100000)`? This will have to loop 50000 times just to find the number we're looking for. Instead, we can define a symbol for the in-statement, that just checks if the number if bigger or equal to the start value, and smaller than the end value.\nThis is a perfect way to use symbols", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwY-J6xNLidDytDbBd4AaABAg.9UKMJHotmHN9gBorZnAX0Z", "publishedAt": "2022-09-20T09:32:38Z", "author": "Ben Flynn", "text": "@schl\u00f6pp, pp dev Perhaps you'll elaborate with examples ?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgwY-J6xNLidDytDbBd4AaABAg.9UKMJHotmHN9g9R5EeFlA9", "publishedAt": "2022-09-19T11:17:42Z", "author": "schl\u00f6pp, pp dev", "text": "Every object you use has symbols.
