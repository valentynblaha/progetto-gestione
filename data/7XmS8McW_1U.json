There are two problem with this approach. 1. Substring iterates over a string in O(n) time. 2. Substring creates a copy of the string (because it is immutable). So it needs O(n) time for each iteration and O(n - 1) = O(n) space for each iteration, which makes it O(n^2) time and space complexity when adding.\nI suggest using an array (word.split(\"\")) and passing around both the array itself and current index when adding the word. Benefits: we don't do substring, we simply iterate index by one. Both of these are done in O(1) time and don't use any extra space.\n\nOther than that I'd use while loop to iterate over the the nodes instead of using recursion. This allows us not to worry about recursion stack overflowing (which may or may not become an issue in the long run).\n\nI realize this is a 3 year old video, I'm just hoping someone will find this useful, as I found this video quite useful for understanding Tries and how to implement them in JS.\n\nThanks for the explanation!

Also if you \"return condition && 123\" you are returning  123 if the condition is true but with with \"return condition && 123 ? true : false\" you are returning a boolean.
