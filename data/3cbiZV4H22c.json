Great video, and very useful. But two things: it was hard to follow because it seemed to be fast forwarded, and new concepts were being introduced in rapid succession, making it hard to keep up. The second thing is it was difficult to follow when the console log was halfway cut off of the screen and you kept jumping back and forth between the console and the environment. And yet, a whole wealth of black space exists in the middle of the screen. If you would just move the screen margins over so the viewer can see the whole environment and the whole of the console, that would be very helpful for comprehension.", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Blaze Taylor", "text": "@Jonah Princeton happy to help :D", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Jonah Princeton", "text": "@Blaze Taylor thanks, signed up and it seems like a nice service :) I appreciate it!", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Blaze Taylor", "text": "@Jonah Princeton flixportal xD", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Jonah Princeton", "text": "i realize I'm quite off topic but do anyone know a good website to stream new tv shows online ?", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Christian Herrero", "text": "I always thought that JS code was interpreted, not compiled.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Jessie Torres", "text": "Great explanation! :-)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Van Thuan Luong", "text": "very nice. thanks", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "ACE THOMAS", "text": "Does anyone know how to write JavaScript functions for games (street wars)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "TehRackoon", "text": "This video explained the value of let and const to me in es6", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Don Feto", "text": "my favorite number is 7", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Osama Abbas", "text": "what a great explanation!", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Martin Bozinovski", "text": "var a = 2;\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n  var a = 3\r\n  console.log(a);\r\n};\r\nfoo();\r\nconsole.log(a);\r\nfoo();\nprints: \n3\n2\n3\nThis is different from the thing you said.
