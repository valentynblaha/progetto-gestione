It's a bit tricky since you may have to do this from your Administrator account (not just your user account with Administrator privileges). Anyway, you just add the line cmd.exe /c chcp 1252 in the file before the SET commands. Then you click on that file to run it. It was already in the psql (shell) shortcut, but you need special permissions to modify it.

Many people in the comments have had the same issues with no clear fix. I dug around on the internet quite a bit and found some patch work fixes but I still have no clear understanding of what is wrong or why my Terminal isn't the same as the instructors. A fair warning (this may just be for Windows users?) if you are a beginner this is likely not the course for you. I say this because when learning new skills it is worth while to get some minor successes before you start running into larger hurdles to get the momentum going.

You can walk 'cd..' / 'cd foldername' to the file, but it's better to add a path for the file's folder to your 'user environment variables'.  You can easily find better explanation on internet, but you can also keep reading. In windows 7, go to control panel, user accounts, (left side menu) change variables of my environment (or something like that). Probably theres alrdy a PATH variable with some value. If not, create it. So you edit it, add a comma in the end of existing value and enter a new path to the folder (not file) where psql.exe rests peacefully. In windows 10 (and probably win7 too actually) you may press window-key and search for system environment variables. There you don't need to add comma+newpath, you can just add a new entry.\n\n\r\nAfter this you will be able to enter psql anywhere.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxuQqWY3y-hXEsSABx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-20T17:20:38Z", "author": "Hope Guo", "text": "Thank you so much, you are amazing.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz_Sk2aCJHirCk4bzd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-11-18T09:39:43Z", "author": "Dharan Prasad.

I'm typing in \"help\" to get commands, and it says \\h for sql help, and \\? for psql help. I typed in \\? assuming it would show me the same PSQL help it shows on the video, but it shows a completely different set of commands, al starting with \\ instead of with --.\nI haven't watched the rest of the video, but so far it seems like it's different for windows. I hope not.\n\nEDIT: I did manage to do the rest of the tutorial without problems, it works on windows aswell, I just skipped this step in particular. Wonderful tutorial. However I'm having trouble trying to add a NOT NULL constraint to an already created row. Is this possible? I'm using \" ALTER TABLE person MODIFY name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL; \" and it says there's a syntax error around modify.
