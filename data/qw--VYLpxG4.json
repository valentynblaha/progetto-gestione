You can easily find better explanation on internet, but you can also keep reading. In windows 7, go to control panel, user accounts, (left side menu) change variables of my environment (or something like that). Probably theres alrdy a PATH variable with some value. If not, create it. So you edit it, add a comma in the end of existing value and enter a new path to the folder (not file) where psql.exe rests peacefully. In windows 10 (and probably win7 too actually) you may press window-key and search for system environment variables.
