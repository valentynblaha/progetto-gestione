You start developing your application using this version. Lets say 2 months from now, a new version drops with better features, more functionality, etc and you want to use it. So you update it.  However, this new version may have changed certain core functionalities and now your app doesn't work, since it uses features from a prior version that no longer exist. If you use a venv, you can have one venv with the old version that you can still use for development and another venv with the newer version.\n\nAnother reason to create venvs is when you install libraries that depend on various other libraries, ex: pytorch, tensorflow, so that there are no dependancy conflicts.\n\nThat's why the best practice is to leave python as is once installed and create a venv for every project.", "likes": 7}, {"id": "Ugz4cqmKlCuNbmpjSn54AaABAg.9ItXeQOyrtY9NgepIQelpy", "publishedAt": "2021-05-23T15:52:45Z", "author": "Sebastian", "text": "I dont think he explained why one should have a virtualenv..

Happy Coding!\n\nUpdate:\n\nIts subtle but after scrapping my code and starting over, I realized what was happening is that for whatever reason the lesson skipped parts. Particularly the portion where 'render_initial_data' is added to the urls. It is also confusing because at this point in the tutorial the 'products\\views.py' has been cleaned out on his code editor. Remember to update the urls file (in 'products\\urls.py' if youre putting it there, or in the '<root>\\path_to\\urls.py' if you're using the root of the project) by importing and setting a path for 'render_initial_data'. From there, you should be able to continue with the tutorial.

This method does any cleaning that is specific to that particular attribute, unrelated to the type of field that it is. This method is not passed any parameters. You will need to look up the value of the field in self.cleaned_data and remember that it will be a Python object at this point, not the original string submitted in the form (it will be in cleaned_data because the general field clean() method, above, has already cleaned the data once).\"\n\nself.cleaned_data has to occur in reference to a subclass and my indentation indicated otherwise.

Don't know if he wanted us to install 2.7.15 (maybe he makes that clear later).\n\n\nHe did say when creating the virtual environment that if you had 3.6 as your default (python -V) the command had to include '-p python3 .' and if your default (python -V) is 3.6, then omit that portion; but again not explaining at all. After lots of googling, stack overflow, etc., I ran with the omission, leaving the period. Nothing worked. I had to actually name an environment as part of the command. The way he did it was not clear and didn't correspond to any other explanation I was able to find searching. \n\n\nMy installed default python -V was 2.7.10. Nothing worked. I tried installing 2.7.15 as python2. Then, python2 -m virtualenv <newenvname> worked. Activating it with source /bin/activate also didn't work. source newenvname/bin/activate worked for me. Again, a lot of researching and precious little explanations.\n\n\nLook, he's impressive, and I want to follow this tutorial. I already did the Django Documentation tutorials.

But I'd like to make some constructive criticism: I would have much rather seen how to do a slug based lookup, or a bit about front-end users, or some real world validation, etc... than watching you redo the views 3 times using different methods. This is especially no good for beginners. Too many design choices can be absolutely paralyzing for a beginner. They will spend too much time deciding which to use when they could be writing some app logic and getting real experience. And if you focus on one method they will become more competent and confident in it. It'll also be more memorable.

I discovered this with the command \"manage.py inspect db\". After i deleted the db and the migraton files it somehow just restores them and does tries an old migration and since you have changed the class you'll get an error. So first of all you need a primary key in every table, so at the top of your class ad a field called id like so: id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True), the quit the server in the other terminal with ctrl+c, then run the makemigrations command, and then run the migrate command. You'll notice it does a bunch of changes with a list of processes and OK behind them. Then run the server again and you are good. Also it is a good practice to stop the server before you delete crucial files like datastores schemes or db's. Keep that in mind..
