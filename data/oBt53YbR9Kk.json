It can help you solve complex programming problems, such as those often seen in programming interview questions about data structures and algorithms.\n\nThis course was developed by Alvin Zablan from Coderbyte. Coderbyte is one of the top websites for technical interview prep and coding challenges.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Check out the Coderbyte channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOJtQcnBnIy4LERo6vkrItg\n\ud83d\udd17 Improve your coding and interview skills: https://coderbyte.com/member?promo=janpromo4351&utm_source=FCC&utm_medium=Video&utm_campaign=promo&utm_content=Dynamic%20Programming (NOT an affiliate link)\n\nThis course uses images and animations to help you visualize problems and important concepts. After understanding problems conceptually, you will learn how to solve them in JavaScript using Dynamic Programming. Even though JavaScript is used in this course, you will learn concepts and knowledge that you can apply to other programming languages.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Course Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (00:00:00) course introduction\n\u2328\ufe0f (00:03:30) fib memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (00:38:39) gridTraveler memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:04:52) memoization recipe\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:09:56) canSum memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:29:29) howSum memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (01:52:06) bestSum memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (02:12:45) canConstruct memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (02:38:36) countConstruct memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (02:47:30) allConstruct memoization\n\u2328\ufe0f (03:10:53) fib tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (03:22:17) gridTraveler tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (03:34:32) tabulation recipe\n\u2328\ufe0f (03:37:59) canSum tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (03:53:01) howSum tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (04:07:21) bestSum tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (04:20:50) canConstruct tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (04:38:06) countConstruct tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (04:50:23) allConstruct tabulation\n\u2328\ufe0f (05:07:44) closing thoughts\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Special thanks to our Champion supporters! \u2b50\ufe0f \n\ud83c\udfc6 Loc Do\n\ud83c\udfc6 Joseph C\n\ud83c\udfc6 DeezMaster\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news", "duration": "PT5H10M2S", "likes": "97311", "views": "3283939"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyKQfcuKuBIXfXWFO54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2023-02-03T09:58:47Z", "author": "Niklas R\u00f6rbrink", "text": "Second example could preform better if you implemeted what you talked about before coding the solution, right?

University gave us little to no experience in programming (we just had two programming courses in computer engineering) and after graduations i felt like my skills were very weak and coding was my biggest fear. This course gave me confidence and made me realize  once and for all that coding is 80% thinking and 20% writing actual code. Now i can't say i'm a pro but i feel a lot better and i passed the exam with 30/30 so a complete success! Unfortunately i'm still studying so i don't have a job, but i will donate once i have a stable income! For everyone worrying about failure, trust yourself, you're smart enough, i know you can do it!

But otherwise it returns True if proceeded with the other test cases.\n\nNote in my definition of the function canSum I gave memo={} to have a clear new memo every time the function was called from the bottom print lines.

Even more oddly if I specify print(canSum(7,[2,4],memo={})) at the bottom it does work even if I run this after other printed function calls that normally broke it. Which means resetting the memo manually makes it work.\n\nI feel like there's something I don't get about how local variables work in Python that apparently works different in JS.\nI also don't understand how any previous value of memo would result in this weird situation.

I watched that video and luckily the last question he gets directly addresses this. Essentially variables have a scope in Python. A variable you define in a function won't survive after returning out of the function (except by returning it out directly). However, when you give a function a default value like memo = {} in howSum, this basically makes the variable memo directly referenced by a function and so always in scope since a function is always in scope.\n\nWhat that means is our memo object will just keep growing and changing as we call on the function. 7,[2,4] returns 2,2,3 it thinks it can use 3 since 3 is still in the memo. I can only assume Javascript doesn't work this way and that's why the code works for him, but not us.\n\nFrom the last bit of the video I linked:\n\"Default values are held onto by the function itself. If you use a list as a default value for a function argument that is a value that is referred to by the function object itself and so it will stick around forever and be used for every function call that gets made [...] it'll grow indefinitely and surprise you\"\n\nThe stupidly easy fix is to just not have a keyword assignment for memo in the function itself. This way the memo object falls out of scope every time the function finishes its recursion, and means we have a clean memo for each print.\n\nHow that looks in our code:\ndef howSum(targetSum, numbers, memo):\nblah blah blah\n\nprint(howSum(7,[2,3],{})\n\nThe only difference between what we did and what we're doing now is we pass along an empty dictionary to be used as the argument for memo, rather than having memo default to {}. This allows memo to fall out of scope and be reset on the next function call. \n\nHope this helps.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgzuXiUBJi7NHAfV4tx4AaABAg.9gZwvQ5F4Hs9gk8O5wrr1y", "publishedAt": "2022-10-04T02:45:24Z", "author": "DAS", "text": "@Courtney Singleton I ran into another recursion problem with variables when making a recursive version of Markov chains.

The time complexity of the Fibonacci function is \u0398(Z^n) where Z is the golden ratio.\n\nThis tutorial is great, but there is a problem in the Fibonacci function's time complexity.\n\nThe time complexity O(2^(n/2)) is technically reducible to O(2^n) in the way that O(2^(n/2)) is reducible to O(n^n) (if you use O(f(n)) to mean the upper-bound time complexity).\n\nHowever, it is likely that you mean O(f(n)) as the tight bound time complexity (both lower and upper bounds reduce to O(f(n))), which can more accurately be noted as \u0398(f(n)). In which case, \u0398(2^(n/2)) is NOT reducible to \u0398(2^n).\n\nFor time complexity, the following rules exist:\n1) You can remove (divide) *constant multipliers*.\n2) You can remove smaller terms.\n\nExamples:\n\u0398(5n) -> \u0398(n)\n\u0398(5000) -> \u0398(1)\n\u0398(log2(n^2)) -> \u0398(2log2(n)) -> \u0398(log2(n))\n\u0398(log2(n) + log3(n)) -> \u0398(log2(n) + log2(n)/log2(3)) -> \u0398((1 + 1/log2(3))log2(n)) -> \u0398(log2(n))\n\u0398(3n^2 + 7n + 10) -> \u0398(n^2)\n\n\u0398(2^(n/2)) is NOT reducible to \u0398(2^n) in the same way that \u0398(2^n) is not reducible to \u0398(3^n). You cannot divide by any constant to make the two terms equivalent. \u0398(2^(n/2)) is approximately \u0398(1.41421^n).\n\nIt is true that the time complexity for fibonacci is between \u0398(2^(n/2)) and \u0398(2^n) as you suggested, though. Specifically, the closed form time complexity of fib(n) is \u0398(Z^n) where Z is the golden ratio.\n\nI won't go into the actual calculation as it is not very relevant to the conversation and likely wouldn't be expected from a programmer.

I think it is a mistake. When depicting it as a tree, in the tree both these steps are taken at \"one level\". So the number of levels will always be max(n,m). Hence the time complexity should be O(2^max(n,m)). The example of (2,3) has only 3 levels of grid. But it doesn't matter because still the time complexity is \"exponential with regards to the number of input elements\". Nothing wrong conceptually, I pointed out a numeric mistake.\n\nSimilarly, the space complexity is also O(max(n,m)) because at any given time the stack is not going to have n+m elements.\n\nKeep up the great work", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzdcv7eaux5lwZOFCd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-31T18:56:46Z", "author": "T A", "text": "Thanks", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwnVTtIvB7OGWrwiMd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-31T16:27:49Z", "author": "Joshua Campbell", "text": "I don't know the best way to clarify the canConstruct complexity analysis by I will try, the improvement we experience by implementing the memo takes us from O(n^m * m) time to O(n * m^2) time. This improvement can be explained by understanding that Big O is a notation that aims to capture the asymptotic complexity of an algorithm as numbers grow to inifinity. What alvin breezes over is the fact that the brute force solution (n^m) *m actually becomes (n * m) * m, this further simplifies to n * m^2. The main thing to realize here is that we will save time on duplicate effort, and that we don't know the exact savings as it will differ from input to input, (some inputs may have do effort that needs to be memoized) hence, the best we can assume for our asymptotic upper bound, is that it will be some factor of n ( the target.length) and m (the branching factor) the justification is that instead of having m be mulplied for every 1 in n. we only need to multiple every 1 in n by a single scalar, m - where m is now the number of unique entries in the wordbank.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwb7L5cES0iP_D_7jV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-31T15:20:13Z", "author": "Kun Ran", "text": "The moment I saw that tabulation approach for `canSum`, my eyes sparkles!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwR66GaL8I-w2lo9XZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-31T13:42:11Z", "author": "Mufassir Azam", "text": "The sum problems show StackOverflowError", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugw7-K4m_iz-dM15SwV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-31T08:09:07Z", "author": "Jack Mac", "text": "What would the binary tree look like for, find all prime numbers up until N and find their sum.\nI have tried to draw trees but can't see anything repeating to memoize... even a binary tree for find all primes up to 1000... ta", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwdv_nHh7Qm9Dt8ZUJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-30T22:33:45Z", "author": "S Chan", "text": "What kind of software tools did you use to create this presentation?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzfdHCwHamiCTBauct4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-30T08:49:56Z", "author": "Weed Whisperer", "text": "could someone please translate the canSum function into python? the memoized version", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgzfdHCwHamiCTBauct4AaABAg.9bdm8tfYHgY9iUiD_0JkHz", "publishedAt": "2022-11-16T10:42:58Z", "author": "SparrowC1", "text": "def cansum(target_sum, numbers, memo=None):\n\n    if memo is None:\n        memo ={}\n    if target_sum in memo:\n        return memo[target_sum]\n    if target_sum<0:\n        return False\n    if target_sum in numbers:\n        return True\n\n    for i in numbers:\n        if cansum(target_sum-i, numbers, memo) == True:\n            memo[target_sum] = True\n            return True\n    memo[target_sum] = False\n    return False", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwbWbmsRLQPP7ghMAx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-30T04:22:18Z", "author": "Jodomo", "text": "Hands down THE best course on DP.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyWvho0GVitieCkAWd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-29T11:11:49Z", "author": "Sushant Kumar", "text": "Good one", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx7ccWHaV7yLoLoW-B4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-28T21:14:48Z", "author": "SOMESH VEMULA", "text": "This video is gold.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxV90ammsZmlz1D7D14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-05-28T02:18:32Z", "author": "Christopher O'Grady", "text": "My notes so far:\n1) gridTraveler space complexity looks like O(NxM) to me.

It seems python is first-class based, so as we create functions, they are treated as object and as such, bindings will carry over every time the same function is called because it is being interpreted essentially as the same object.  So when you have foo(1), foo(2), foo(3) all called consecutively, then in python, they are all seen as the same object.  So the solution to this in Python is to add variables in the function call, set to none. So that each time a new function call is executed, it will reset that variable.\n\nso by putting sumMemoization(7, [2, 3], result=None) and then the first like in the code will say if result==None: my_dict = dict(), this will reset my_dict to an empty dictionary the first time each function is being called, effectively resetting that value to empty so the results from the previous call do not carry over\n\nthis issue in python has heavily been discussed in a stackedoverflow forum I came across as follow\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1132941/least-astonishment-and-the-mutable-default-argument", "likes": 1}, {"id": "Ugw3KzXpzW50dTAgkPZ4AaABAg.9_jELbnP-FS9_r1xf-Phyi", "publishedAt": "2022-04-15T19:24:09Z", "author": "A.", "text": "Can I do this ? \nbool canSum(int sum, int index) {\r\n\tif (sum == x)\r\n\t\treturn 1;\r\n\tif (sum > x)\r\n\t\treturn 0;\r\n\tbool tst = 0;\r\n\tfor (int i = index; i < n; i++)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttst = canSum(sum + arr[i], i);\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn tst;\r\n\r\n}\n\nLike starting the loop from the current index, not from zero all over again as this is more optimized?", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwSe9ipwN4Ji71I3LF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-04-12T10:07:59Z", "author": "Manoj S", "text": "great tutorial, very understandable teaching", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxK2YT0-_xfxvUfDv54AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-04-12T04:43:22Z", "author": "Sounak Ranjan Das", "text": "Thanks!

One of the best algorithm videos I've seen.  Very clear and concise.  Just would like to note something interesting Iv'e figured out while playing around with variations of the sum memoizations.  Whenever you are implementing brute force for say... bestSum(), you do not need to iterate over the remainderCombination array with the spread operator which is an O(m) operation.  Since this array is calculated at each branch, you can actually use remainderCombination.push(num) which is O(1)!!  This means that instead of O(n^m * m), the brute force time complexity can actually be O(n^m)!  Interestingly enough, you cannot use the O(1) .push() method when memorizing because it will manipulate and append to the best arrays of all of it's children targets since they are all the same array in memory.

Meaning that if the length of the array to copy is n, it's going to take n amount of operations to copy it to another array.\r\n\r\nSince you're already saving the result from the previous 1 level deeper recursion in the remainderResult constant (null or an array), that array itself isn't being used for anything in the algorithm and therefore, it doesn't need to be kept in its original state for any purpose whatsoever. The very act of copying that array only to append just one number to the new array's end, is an unnecessary operation that adds more time to time complexity of the algorithm - which can be avoided.\r\n \r\nSo instead of copying the array, you can use the original array in the remainderResult constant and simply append the num to its end. array.push(num) is a method of O(1) time if you're appending just one value (which you are) and therefore avoiding the whole (* m) added time, coming from first copying the previous array into a new one.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*Instead of this:*\r\n\r\nconst remainderResult = howSum(remainder, numbers, memo);\r\n\r\n// copy array first then append num to the end, then return the array to the calling code\r\nif (remainderResult !== null) return [ ...remainderResult, num ];\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*Do this:*\r\n\r\nconst remainderResult = howSum(remainder, numbers, memo);\r\n\r\nif (remainderResult !== null) {\r\n    // just append num to the end, return the array to the calling code\r\n    remainderResult.push(num);\r\n    return remainderResult;\r\n}\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTime complexities of both solutions (brute force and optimized) are going down because you're no longer copying the array anymore:\r\n\r\n// Brute force\r\n//time: O(n^m * m) --------> O(n^m)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n// Optimized\r\n//time: O(n * m * m) --------> O(n * m)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugwie-TDsLfhxGCiCmd4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-03-10T23:26:57Z", "author": "llekann", "text": "This was very helpful.

(you know it's going to be bad if I give a warning first). But I think this illustrates 3 big, fundamental problems:\n\n1. There is a tendancy among the programming community to set up hurdles for themselves in order to impress others in order so that they can jump those hurdles to impress others.\n2. The other is that if the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.\n3. A desire to use the latest technologies and techniques.\n\nThe first issue I have is the syntax. This is directed to beginners, and the top rated comment is that it took a week to do the tutorial. Keeping it as simple and readable as possible should be the focus. And yet there are 1 line if statements without brackets and ternary operators, etc in there.\n\nAlso related to simplicity, is that we all know there is a very obvious simple sollution to the first problem:\n\nfunction fib(position){\r\n\tvar prev1 = 1;\r\n\tvar prev2 = 0;\r\n\tvar fibNr = 0;\r\n\r\n\tfor(i = 0; i < position; i++){\r\n\t\tprev2 = prev1;\r\n\t\tprev1 = fibNr;\r\n\t\tfibNr = prev2 + prev1;\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn fibNr;\r\n}\n\nI understand that it was there to introduce and set things up. But if you look at the result from the fib code in the video alone it is slower, harder to read and takes up more memory. It is, for all intents and purposes a bad way to solve the problem.\n\nWhich is the hammer nail analogy. Programming is about problem solving, and part of that should be finding the best sollution, not forcing a peg into a square functional programming hole. This gets much worse  in the gridtraveler problem:\n\nThe way it's tackled here is a starting point of \"right, let's bruteforce it and try ALL the combinations\". Which isn't understanding the problem. Look at the information given.\n\nYou have a grid and can go down or right. You start at the top left and need to go to the bottom right.\n\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\nWell, for each column you need to take one step to the right. For every row you need to take 1 step down.\n\nIn a grid of 3 x 3, that is 2 steps down, 2 steps to the right. And then just various combinations. It will always be 4 steps to the goal.10 x 10 grid = 9 steps down + 9 steps to the right to end up on the desired tile. If you write that out the sollution should be obvious:\n\nRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDD (R = right, D = down)\n\nBruteforcing it to find the combinations that have 9 steps down and 9 steps, saving a fantastic amount of data in an array...is silly now that you see the problem half solved.\n\nAll you need to do is move the R & D's around to get all the various combinations. You could put them in an array if you really wanted to and move them around that way, but that is 1 array with a size of 18, not a ginormous one like the one generated in the video. Just loop it out until you've ended up with DDDDDDDDDRRRRRRRRR add something that increments in each loop and boom - done.\n\nAnd that's on what would be the equivilent of the videos unoptimized version. If you wanted to optimize this way of solving it you could calculate the amount of steps it takes to move an R or a D x steps, and find clever ways of doing it. And you could do it easily readable without shorthand and clearly defined functions and loops.\n\nAgain, much more efficiant to keep it simple, and easier to understand.\n\nUltimatly makes you a better programmer as you learn how to solve problems with many different approaches, and ways to solve problems instead of wasting resources to get an intermediate level sollution that sacrifices lots of performance and memory to solve simple math problems.\n\nAnd lets's face it. Programming paradigms will come and go. This code will look very dated 10 years from now, and will probably not make sense to that generation of programmers.\n\nBut...keeping to the basics? That'll still works. It'll still be around. Sure, you may look like a bit of a newbie, but if you don't care about prestige, and get over that, it is also brutally effeciant.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzaAJmPCKDN4QinCqR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-02-12T00:14:45Z", "author": "Ali Lashgari", "text": "I dont think I ever have seen a youtube video with this quality.

If you plug that in the time complexity of the whole algorithm, you'll get O(n^m + m^2). You could leave it like that and argue that, for some values of m and n, the m^2 term will be higher than the n^m, but I'd simply drop the m^2, since those cases only happen for a few values, and it further simplifies the running time. \n\nThus, I think the correct running time should simply be O(n^m)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzKbjpkMZ75lj3rsyB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-14T01:53:14Z", "author": "Amaury Permer", "text": "does const make memo accessible for every fib call that has no memo argument? i mean as far as I can see, memo is being created every fib call that has no memo and this wont work too well if I want the Fibonacci number 50, I tried to call fib.memo and its undefined, at the end I did it with a global array instead of an object.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgzCIoH45-FeJs4IxBV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-13T22:09:42Z", "author": "Uditi Chawla", "text": "Why do we measure time complexity by counting number of nodes at leaf level and not the total number of nodes in the tree since our recursive function has to travel to all the nodes?", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyTTAyjrMGhKWFPBtB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-13T21:18:58Z", "author": "varun aggarwal", "text": "thanx, you help me in understanding other big problems, I was scratching my head off.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyQtVJNbt7sr2hvuJB4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-13T17:09:28Z", "author": "Nikita Tolkachev", "text": "\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e!", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxiqcmWRtVl7DbYjxl4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-01-13T05:30:37Z", "author": "PeterParker", "text": "This man is the real deal.

So I skipped the countConstruct & allConstruct parts, as they no doubt suffer so as well.  *Finally,* 3 hours into a 5 hour lesson, Alvin starts teaching the iterative methods.  Even there, he makes the bizarre choice of adding forward to the next 2 positions, instead of adding the 2 prior positions.  This is bizarre for 2 reasons: the value in position 1 is already set, so it makes no sense to add anything to it (even if that thing is 0); and it introduces the array bounds problem.  Doing the look-back method avoids both of those issue, and removes the need to preset the table to all 0, since you never need to access any value before setting it anyway.\n\nOf course, my above method avoids even creating a table.  Likewise, my solution for gridTraveler avoids the table with a simple calculation.\n\nMy overall opinion of this lesson is 'not that good'.

In the beginning, when explaining the 2*3 grid, you pointed out that you are going to do 1 down move and 2 right moves, in any order.  Well, the total number of ways to partition those up is a well-known problem.

The only reason why this model I described works is because it's summing 2 values and replacing the correct one, but I don't think my approach would work for something that will require \"True\" recursion, as in something that the steps cannot be directed added and replaced. In fact the pendulum aka Grandfather Clock can really just solve a small subset of number sequences and usually the seed numbers have to be altered, sometimes the Middle position the point it passes from all the way Left to all the way Right can be a 3rd value to change along the way.

In fact, O(2^(0.5*n)) is the same as O(sqrt(2)^n), so roughly O(1.415^n). The naively recursive version of fib is O(fib(n)) or O(phi^n), roughly O(1.61^n). More generally, you cannot eliminate constant factors from exponents in O-notation, because this changes the base. Technically, you can bump them up to get a non-tight upper bound, but you lose precision. Some people use the notation 2^O(n) for exponential functions, throwing them all into the same class, but O(2^n) and O(3^n) are not the same set of functions, so 2^O(n) is a coarser classification than O-notation normally provides.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugx7pHUMCzLdxluSgPt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-11-20T12:54:06Z", "author": "LearningRabbit", "text": "One thing that I noted is when I move the memo check from the top to where my recursive call is made (inside the if statement) , my program runs fine for bigger inputs.

But a couple of nitpicks with about 1:50 left in the course.  Which I will finish, because the course is embedding this clear crisp way of thinking into my brain:\n\n1) It seems that the presenter is fully aware of when to use a new array, vs when to use a modified array, but that isn't talked about.  The first example I said \"the spread operator is cool, but you could use push onto the old array.  But when he continued to the next example, it was obvious that we wanted the array for memoization.  Then I thought - so This is functional programming, where not mutating variables gives you access to memoization.  And then later when he creates the results array, it is done by modifying the array.  Which made sense; but it was a seamless transition without any explanation.\n\n2) In his tabular fibonacci example the iterator should have stopped at \"i < n\" and not \"i <= n\", *and* there needs to be either an additional element to the array or an if statement that doesn't update table[n+2] if n is at the end.  Or, feel free to go to stop at n, but have n+1and n+2 defined in table, meaning you need a table with n+3 elements (which includes the 0th array element used in the algorithm).  All of this works in his example, because javascript automagically created two elements at the end which have an undefined status at first.  Undefined plus a number = NaN.  And then for table[n + 1], NaN + a number results in NaN.  So no exxeptions here, but in java or c you would have had an out of bounds exception.  Raku starts a new element with the default  'any',  converts it to 0 when used in a math equation,  and produces the correct number, which allows you to start with a 2 element array (0 and 1) and dynamically create the rest.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugxtbk4vWrWWDpgoFP54AaABAg.9TvJHIA3AjZ9TvZ-zGLVM-", "publishedAt": "2021-10-25T13:50:10Z", "author": "PureAbsolute", "text": "Hah - for whatever reason, my two nitpicks are explained literally in the next example.

It's like counting AB and BA except the letters are AA, so it counts AA and AA as if they were two distinct combinations).\n\nHow do we not double count? \n\nWell, there are only 'down' and 'right' - so simply by dividing our (m + n - 2)! by (m - 1)! (permutations of 'down') * (n - 1)! (permutations of 'right')\n\nthat is, all redundant permutations of 'down' (2 rows) and all redundant permutations of 'right' (2 columns) are addressed.\n\nSo the answer is \n(3 + 3 - 2)! \n-------------------------- = 4! / 2! * 2! = 24 / 2 * 2 = 6\n(m - 1)! * (n - 1)!", "likes": 5}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugwj8f77NuQMC5KxL4t4AaABAg.9T0Ine7TZqW9VmMQ6rbxeh", "publishedAt": "2021-12-10T17:09:45Z", "author": "ClockFixer", "text": "@Christopher Mitchell indeed", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugwj8f77NuQMC5KxL4t4AaABAg.9T0Ine7TZqW9VhaPCqW21b", "publishedAt": "2021-12-08T20:44:30Z", "author": "Christopher Mitchell", "text": "Very simple, indeed.

Imagine you start with a large target. Somewhere down the tree you have target = 7 and numbers = [9, 4, 3, 2]. The remainder for the first loop would be -2 and can_sum is False. You would memoize a target of 7 as returning False. On the next iteration of the loop you consider number 4 and can_sum is True and returns True up the stack. In a different branch you later encounter another target = 7. This time can_sum will return False from the memo. Obviously this is incorrect since 4 + 3 = 7. You would still end up with the correct result overall because the first branch would end up True overriding any erroneously False branches. The issue is if you re-use this logic on a different problem like all_sums where you have to return the full array of numbers that sum to the target 7. Only one branch would return an array, when the correct answer would be [ [4, 3], [3, 2, 2] ]. \n\nIf you changed it to memo[remainder] = False inside the loop that at least give correct results consistently, but then you're doing the \"look before you leap\" antipattern.

Here's a proof.\nLet's assume they are the same complexity.\n2^(a * n) = O(2^n)\n2^(a * n) <= c * 2^n\nln2 * a * n <= lnc + ln2 * n\na * n <= lnc / ln2 + n\n(a - 1) * n <= lnc / ln2\nln2 * (a - 1) * n <= lnc\n2^((a - 1) * n) <= c\n\nThis only holds for a <= 1. Therefore, complexity changes with a. a = 1.5 produces the case mentioned above. a = 1 is constant time: O(1).\n\nYes, O(2^n) can represent an upper bound, but you can say the same about O(n^2) being an upper bound for n.

The BSP tree concept was/is simple, but how it was applied to enable back to front rendering in a 3D world took me a bit to get my head around. After that you move on to quadtrees and octrees.

Suppose we return the first solution of [3, 5], we can also say if we had a howSum(8, [0, 2, 3, 5]) we could have returned [0, 3, 5] and it'd still be a valid answer. But since we don't actually have the zero in the input set, we have to \"return\" it(cut it out of the final output). Conversely, if we have an unsolvable case of say, howSum(20, [7, 14]) then even if we \"borrow\" the zero then it makes no difference; the solution is still going to be null.\nSo, when we have an input like howSum(0, [1, 2, 3]) we could again \"borrow\" the zero to have howSum(0, [0, 1, 2, 3]) with  solution of  [0] but since we have to \"return\" the zero the actual solution is going to be just []. This way we can justify the step of assuming the empty array to be a valid answer for a sum of 0.\n\nNote that \"borrowing and returning\" any other number(which is not an additive identity) won't work.

Hence, we can think of every path through the grid being some permutation of (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2 down and right moves. If we think of each of these down/right moves as being a symbol, it follows that there (n+m-2)! ways to permute these symbols. However, as not every symbol is unique, we will have some duplicate permutations. Indeed, say we are choosing a permutation from a collection of symbols [D, D, R] - then the permutation we obtain by first choosing the first D, then the second D, then finally the R will be the same as the permutation we obtain by first choosing the second D, then the first D, then finally the R. Thus, we need to consider the number of ways in which we can permute the D and R symbols amongst a chosen permutation. As there are (n-1) and (m-1) of them respectively, there will be (n-1)! and (m-1)! ways to permute them respectively. Therefore, we need only divide the total number of permutations by the ways to permute the duplicate symbols and we arrive at the final solution of (n+m-2)!/((n-1)!(m-1)!) paths through the n*m grid.", "likes": 8}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugw6k3dUAf1tGjHJtt14AaABAg.9PVjd7KGX8n9TWMrXUWwxj", "publishedAt": "2021-10-15T09:43:45Z", "author": "Devbom", "text": "@Daniel Melo I agree this is a much more elegant solution, however, implemented correctly the dynamic programming version of grid traveler is much faster (in Python 3.8).

This screams OutOfBounds so much with safety checks for it all over the place.\nWhy not just start at array[2] and do array[i] = array[i-1] + array[i-2]? This is so much safer as you can catch the case of fib(1) or below to default to 1 or 0 and compute the rest with the start as array[]={0,1,0,0....}\n\nI hope that I didnt miss the explanation given, as I watched it in one go and it is 1:50 already, aka beyond bed time :-)\n\nEdit:\nBeing at the GridTraveler @3:32:30 now, why not just go from table[0][0] = 1 instead as the column table[i][0] and row table[0][j] is always 0, this it is kinda wasted cycles. HOWEVER, if you start with table[0][0] = 1 like suggested before, you can loop up to i < n and j < m and thus do not have to do the if-checks for OutOfBounds safety, as they are inherent to the loop conditions. And to be honest, I kinda assumed that this was the whole reason to go for n+1 and m+1 array-size initializations in the first place when I saw it at the start.\n\nEdit2:\nSorry but the solution @3:52:20 really gives me goosebumps. The outmost loop should have iterated to i < table.length instead of i <= table.length to not run out of bounds there. After all, you run to i <= targetSum youself, with table[targetSum +1] and thus table.length = targetSum + 1. Therefor, running towards  i <= table.length goes 1 farther than i <= targetSum and thus OutOfBounds.\n\nFurthermore,  looping with i <= targetSum only just hides the next issue, the index for the table[i + num] insertion should have been caught properly. Imagine you are doing a canSum(10, [1, 2000000000]). Sure JS doesnt really seem to allocate all the space inbetween, but as this isnt just JS specific but rather a general coding course of sorts, it should have been written more in mind with consistency across all these other languages as well.\n\n\n\nAlso please dont get me wrong. Your video is awesome! It is pure gold and worth a lot. Most of the stuff I see here, I likely wouldnt have coded like that out of the box and I especially could not visualize it as great as you did!\n\nSo I am simply just \"nagging\" on a high level and kinda legit asking for my own understandings, in case I missed something myself.\n\nThat said, please dont feel let down in any way for this great content.

This means  'if (targetSum in memo) return memo[targetSum]' is the same as 'if (targetSum in memo) return false;' This also means that once we find a branch yielding a value, the function will no longer venture into other branches, hence no more null values will propagate.\n2. Once we find a summable combination, we can save space by return just the array and not adding the array into the memo.

Instead of storing the arrays, we could store an array with the indices of the used words in the numbers array. What I mean is, we could have a memo object which would take as keys the possible substrings and for each substring, we would have found ways to achieve the target word using some words. E.g. if we have the word abcdef and [a, ab, c, d, e, f], we would have a memo that looks like this: {abcdef: [index of a in number, index of ab in number], bcdef: [index of b in number], cdef: [index of c in number], def: [index of d in number], ef: [index of e in number], f:[index of f in number]}. This could be done in polynomial time (<= m calls (for each possible suffix string), for each of them n words that would be added to the dynamic array, that is m*n, but since we also check if a word starts with a substring using indexOf, it's actually m*n*m(the last m is for the checking of substring)). When we want to use those values to create the 2d array, we would just do it in a similar way. Now we could call the complexity of the \"unpacking\" is d and the overall complexity is polynomial + d. Now d would be exponential in terms of n and m, but if given some other values like the biggest number d is or something else even more complex, we could get a non-exponential complexity. On a competitive programming problem, this could be simply given. In a real-world situation, we could just decide we are interested in the first k values or whatever.

Unless I am missing something I think there is a small mistake in the time and space complexity of howSum:\nThere is no need to store the positive result (an array in this case) in the memo object, since as soon as we find one good result, we stop the exploration and just return all the way up, so no other recursive call will be made, and the memo object will never be checked again. Only storing false/null is useful.\nBy that logic, even if you do store the array in memo, at most there will be a single array of length m in memo, so the space complexity would be O(m*2) so O(m) and not O(m*m).\nIn the same way, we are going to create a new array at most m times (a single path will ever return an array, never multiples, so 1 time per node in the path), so time complexity of copying the arrays would be O(m) again, for a total time complexity of O(n*m+m) instead of O(n*m^2).\nSo basically, you are assuming that in the worst-case scenario (say a numbers array filled with 1) every single path will return an array, while in reality it's always at most 1 path, since we stop all exploration as soon as we have one match.\n\nAm I missing something?", "likes": 7}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwZKM9jIBq-4VPBHdp4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-02-17T20:17:12Z", "author": "ValchyGaming", "text": "Really good video.

(Side note: \"memoization\", not \"memorization\".)\r\n\r\nKEY INSIGHT WHEN MEMOIZING here: unlike in the brute force case, neither countConstruct nor allConstruct exhaustively \"explore the full recursive search space tree\", *even in the worst case scenario.*\r\n\r\nWhy? Because memoizing short-circuits many recursive-call branches of this exhaustive search. Consider: for a target input of length m, there are a maximum of m \"suffixes to explore\". At any given point in the tree, you've either \"solved\" that suffix, or you haven't. You only need to do that m times, ever, with memoization (not n^m times, like in brute force, which ignores duplicate effort). At any point, either:\r\n1) this is your first and only time ever needing to solve the suffix (and memoize the result), or\r\n2) you've already seen and memoized the solution of the suffix, so its recursive search branch is effectively pruned.\r\n\r\nSo, what makes the difference between countConstruct and allConstruct? The nature of the result itself (and the memoization characteristics).\r\n\r\nSums aggregate, so countConstruct's result is a single number, as are all of its memoized entries for every possible suffix (max of m). If you've seen a suffix before, you just add its count to all the other suffixes' counts at this level, and that answer now represents the answer for the longer suffix. This \"aggregation\" of counts is O(n), in each case (n items to sum), and it only needs to be done a max of m times---once for each suffix---resulting in O(n*m). (Again, this is neglecting slicing.)\r\n\r\nHowever, in the case of allConstruct, the *memos themselves are exponential* in nature, requiring that every possible construction for each suffix be enumerated within its memo rather than just a single count number. And, every time you have seen a suffix before, **even though you don't need to \"recursively re-solve it\"**, you still must combine it with all other suffixes' possible constructions at that same level in order to define the answer for the longer suffix. This ultimately results in exponential behavior even though you still only need to do this \"aggregation\" a maximum of m times. This is because the combination of constructions is itself O(n^k), where k is the current suffix's length. In the worst case, for a suffix of length k, there are n^(k-1) possible constructions for EACH \"child suffix\", and to construct the (k-length) suffix's result, you must combine all n of those n^(k-1)-sized construction sets, i.e., build a set to memoize that is n*(n^(k-1)) = n^k in size. This remains true at the top, where k=m, so the final result is O(n^m) time (again, neglecting slicing).\r\n\r\nRecommendation: as just an example case, think carefully about that final test input, minus its terminal letter. Once you've \"solved\" the top-most, left-most recursive branch (let's call it L-branch), none of the other branches need to be recursively called down into any deeper than the first level because every possible suffix below that has already been memoized inside L-branch. (This is similarly true for branches inside L-branch, working down through it.) The only thing that must be done is to combine those other first level prefixes with any relevant already-memoized suffixes.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I commented elsewhere on this video that characterizing the allConstruct algorithm as O(m) space is just plain wrong, for both brute force and memoized versions.

I can answer your question and im not sure if this is the correct answer but i teach myself this way. My english not that great but i will try.  \r\n\n    When you've come to the if statement inside of a for loop, the program will call another function until  the remainder below 0.\r\n\n   First you are going with 7.  Remainder = 7-2 =5. And then in if statement you are calling function again. but  this time you are going with targetsum=5 because your remainder=5 . Then you come inside of loop and your remainder now equals to 3. And you doing it again and now your remainder is 1. Once you hit remainder=1 you dont go further because if you call function with targetsum=1 your remainder will be -1 which is not allowed in this problem.So you stop when your remainder = 1 which now become your targetsum. You will go backward for other number in array which is 3.

Javascript, the language used in the video, works slightly different than Python.  This call's syntax is legal in both Python and Javascript (shown below and leaving off proper function definition syntax for the respective language), but they have huge difference in how they act:\n... *canSum(targetSum, numbers, memo={})*\n\nIn Javascript, memo will exist only for the function *call* (i.e. the function will dispose of memo, and other mutable values at the end of the _initial_ function call).  For recursive calls, I think the call stack will still allow *memo* to persist so long as the base call is on the call stack.  Once the base/initial function call is over, memo is lost. \n\nHowever, for Python, memo will exist, and persist, at function *definition* .  This means that Python will create the array and have it persist throughout the lifetime of the global namespace of the program.  This means, that all calls to canSum, even calls that make initial calls to canSum, will all operate on the same memo value.  So true and false values in memo from previous calls will be used for future calls to canSum that should operate with a completely new and empty mutable value.  This will inevitably cause problems.\n\nTo fix this for Python, just take out the default value in the function definition and include an empty dictionary (i.e. '{}') in your function call.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyusxjFhaiBHKUlPgd4AaABAg.9HaeFppJsYp9HiYzW4sza4", "publishedAt": "2020-12-26T06:23:06Z", "author": "ApiolJoe", "text": "@Spirolli Okay, got it! thanks.\nHave a nice day", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyusxjFhaiBHKUlPgd4AaABAg.9HaeFppJsYp9Hi9CNiOofX", "publishedAt": "2020-12-26T02:37:48Z", "author": "Spirolli", "text": "@ApiolJoe I took a look at the code in your last statement and it was fine.  It worked with the test cases I used before (FYI, they were just the test cases used for canSum in the video).\n\nAnd yes, you can conclude that inputting a manual value for memo when the function is called will guarantee that it will work, in so far as you're memo values are logically independent of any other calls to canSum that happen outside the function itself.  If you create a new dictionary at the time of initial/first function call, you'll be good to go.  \n\nKeep in mind, though, that you need to create a *new* dictionary every time that canSum is called.  You can do this by defining a literal (e.g. {0: True}) in the function call or by copying the dictionary before you send it to canSum.\n\nAlso another way to ensure that you have a 'new' memo would be to define the default value of memo=None.  Then write an if statement that checks if the value is None, and, if so, create an empty memo ( e.g. {}) or a memo with your initial values, albeit, this would require some rewrites to other statements in the function.\n\nAs for your final question, I'm not sure exactly why the choice was made to have a complex, mutable objects (i.e. arrays and dictionaries) defined and persist throughout the execution of function's lifetime.  There are ways to avoid this in the writing of code that are simple enough to achieve and according to this webpage (https://web.archive.org/web/20200221224620/http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm), sometimes writing to data that is shared between multiple, can have it's advantage.  If you have to call a particular function, a lot, it's a costly calculation every time a 'new' input is received and you don't care at all about logical independence, using a persistent memo can cut down on operation time.  The webpage above also offers UI design as a apt subject.  A lot of the time you only want to interact with one particular object in a UI, and it doesn't make sense to create a new object every single time.  The problem with _canSum_ is that you *DO* need a logical independence between calls (calling from outside the function).", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgyusxjFhaiBHKUlPgd4AaABAg.9HaeFppJsYp9HgSW8NwWNy", "publishedAt": "2020-12-25T10:48:03Z", "author": "ApiolJoe", "text": "@Spirolli Okay I revisited all the code, here's where I'm at exploring this issue:\n\n#implementation with memoization\ndef canSum_memo(targetsum, numbers, memo={0: True}):\n  if targetsum == 0:\n    return memo[targetsum]\n  for n in numbers:\n    if targetsum >= n:\n      try:\n        if memo[targetsum-n]==True:\n          return True\n      except:\n        memo[targetsum-n] = canSum_memo(targetsum - n, numbers, memo)\n        if memo[targetsum-n]==True:\n          return True\n  return False\n\nSince my bruteforce solution gives the right answer, I'll simply use it as a baseline and make sure the memo version gives the right answer.

I don't know if you copied down your program wrong or something else, but my main point is if someone using Python doesn't adjust their program to handle the case I brought up, they will *probably* get wrong answers.  This isn't the type of wrong where the program will crash, but where you'll get unreliable answers.  Also, what I was discussing won't *necessarily* cause a problem in every case of multiple test cases being run, there's a good chance that the more test cases you run, the likelier that this problem will show up.  \n\nFurthermore, the issue isn't with the code itself, but the way the Python acts under the hood to handle the code.  \n\nThe problem with memo in canSum rear its ugly head when you run *more than one* test cases on the same run ('more than one test case' being important to recognize here).  This will most likely cause problems for multiple test runs that operate within the same global namespace.  A simple example of this is can be shown with this small program:\n\n# Start of program -----\ndef testMemo(value, memo={}):\n     memo[str(value)] = value\n     print(memo)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    testMemo(3)\n    testMemo(5)\n# End of program ---\n\nTaking the above example, we have a _testMemo_ function that takes a value and has a default value of an empty dict for memo.  In javascript, a similar call (i.e. with correct javascript syntax) would produce the following output:\n\n{'3': 3} // For the first call\n{'5': 5} // For the second call\n\nThat's what we want.  We want separate dictionary/objects for different *initial* calls to our function (javascript will keep memo 'alive', or have it persist through recursive calls to itself).  However, in Python (which I tested on an online editor for versions 2.7 and 3.8, and an offline editor for 3.6), we get the following:\n\n{'3': 3} # For the first call\n{'3': 3, '5': 5} # For the second call\n\nWe don't want that.  We want the second call to only have the value {'5': 5}.  And even if you include a value in your memo default value definition (i.e. ... memo={'2': 2} or anything else) you'll just get something similar:\n\n{'2': 2, '3': 3} # For the first call\n{'2': 2, '3': 3, '5': 5} # For the second call --- we don't want '3': 3 here.\n\nLike I said in my previous post, the reason being is that javascript creates memo at function *call* . Meaning, when we call testMemo in a javascript program, javascript *creates* memo every time the testMemo function is called.  Upon returning from its initial call back (the first function call that wasn't a recursive call) to the scope that called it, javascript treats memo as a variable in function scope, and when garbage collecting, throws memo away like every other function scope variable.  \n\nFor Python, the Python interpreter creates memo at function *definition* .  This means when the program is passed to the Python interpreter,  Python reads all functions definitions into the program and creates a function definition for every function in the global namespace (or program namespace).  In the case above, we only have testMemo as function definition and before main is run, Python interprets all function definitions and creates any mutable values in the declaration.  So, when something calls Python's testMemo during the run of 'main', nothing new happens with memo, and when we throw away every function scope variable for Python's testMemo when it's fully run and getting itself off the call stack, memo remains.  We, however, want memo to be tossed when we're leaving testMemo entirely, that way we won't get carryover in a future, unrelated call.\n\nI'm not sure how Javascript handles function definition, but it at least doesn't create memo at function definition,  Python however does.  Python instantiates a memo dictionary at the beginning of its run (BEFORE its even been called) and treats it as a continuously existing variable throughout that program.\n\nThis phenomenon only, potentially causes problems if you're running more than one test case in the same namespace declaration.  If you use something like IDLE and restart the editor every time you run your program with ONE test case, this won't crop up.

It is about memoization (which can be a useful technique in dynamic programming) and about tabulation (which is not related to DP). The first part that covers some simple recursive algorithms could be considered DP as are the explanations about tree-depth and branching factors, but it really just scratches the surface. Consider this video more of a teaser-trailer to the field of DP.\n\nNevertheless I liked the video: the two depicted concepts are certainly very valuable knowledge for beginner programmers.\n\nSome notes that I would like to add:\n- at 2:32:24 you mention the time complexity of slice. I think you should rather look into the time complexity of `indexOf` at the line above (and replace it with a ~ `startsWith` function). Furthermore in javascript all string operations create new strings, so there really is no way of index-based pointing to the original string. It might be worth pointing out that in pointer/reference based languages this might be a possible optimization (e.g. not copying the string every time, but rather using a start-position carry).\n- For the bestSum methods, it might be worth pointing out that sorting your input parameters descendingly reduces the problem complexity to a DFS (depth-first-search).\n- The grid traveler problem is easily solvable as a purely combinatorics-problem and can be calculated in linear time. E.g. you need (m-1) down-moves and (n-1) right moves in total, ie (m+n-2)!/[ (m-1)! * (n-1)! ]. For example (18,18) this would be: 34!/(17!*17!) = 2333606220", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwWfpT4LdQ1pZ7KhhZ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-18T07:47:01Z", "author": "noodnutt", "text": "Here is the VBA equivalent of the Fibonacci problem:\r\n\r\nFor context: My system is only a year old with 32g of Ram and reasonably high-end CPU, sadly though!

Maybe you are getting a little thrown off because there is an inherent off by 1 in this, so when you count the literal height and not just the big O height, you need to account for this off by 1.\n\nSay we have nodes (n, m). If I start with a tree with root (2,3), the farthest leaves are (1,1), not (0, 0). From parent to child I may only decrease either dimension by 1. I need to eventually subtract 1 from the root's n (2) and eventually subtract 2 from the root's m (3) in order to reach a leaf of (1,1). 1 + 2 = 3, the height is 3. If you want to count the literal height of the tree then you should use the formula \"height = m + n - 2\", the -2 is there because we are off by one along m and also n.

I numbered the paragraphs to point out where I talk about certain elements.  At paragraphs 1 and 2, I talk about the non-memoization technique and, at paragraphs 3 to the end, I explain and progressively deep-dive the memoization technique.  Hope this helps.\n\n[1]\nFor the initial implementation, non-memoization technique, the problem required all nodes to be explored every time that a non-zero _target sum_ was called on.  So at each level, the number of elements in our _numbers_ array, would be called on our current _target sum_ .  So put simply, we would have *n* number of calls on our first level (n).  At our second level, we would have n^2 number of calls since we would be calling *n* times on *n* elements of the numbers array.  At the third level, n^3, since we are calling *n* times on *n* multiplied number of elements, *n* .  So on and so forth for future levels.  We would end up with, at worst, *m* levels in the case of a single decrement (i.e. the array contained 1).  That would mean the lowest level would be n^m number of elements being called.\n\n[2]\nSo in Big-O time complexity analysis, we would have O(n + n^2 + n^3 + ... + n^m).  Big-O is usually concerned with the biggest time user/waster and not concerning itself with anything less.  So our Big-O would be just O(n^m).\n\n[3]\nSo for the memoization technique, we have gained the ability to 'remember' values that have already been 'explored' in the tree.  Hence, we don't need to re-explore those values (i.e. expand sub-trees) in subsequent calls that might happen to have the same value occur in them.  If a given value is in the memo, we definitively know, whether or not, that that value will lead to the desired value 0 with the given values in the _numbers_ array.\n\n[4]\nIf you're still having trouble, I'll trace the algorithm call.  The algorithm starts for all cases, the same way, it calls the left-most branch first, in every recursive call, until it hits the base case, expands to every other branch (i.e. iterates through every value of the numbers array), returns to the most recent call and expands that level's branches.  It will expand every level as it 'bubbles' back up to the top, or until it finds true.  In the case that the given canSum _target sum_ with a given array is not possible, or returns false, it *MUST* expand every level until all unique possible combination of values are exhausted; the algorithm won't know that a _target sum_ is not possible, or false, until it iterates through all unique values and finds them not possible.  Here are some cases to check out, if you're still having trouble (drawing the trees helps out):\n\n*_target_sum_** = 7 and numbers=[1]* :\nThe tree will look like a stick, it will have 1 branch, *n* , for every level and will have 7 levels, *m* : 1 call per 7 levels. 7 x 1 = 7.\n\nNow to think of a case that doesn't work.\n\n[5]\n*_target_sum_** = 11 and numbers=[2,4]* : \nBy simple inductive reasoning, one can tell pretty quickly that the above case can not be solved.  The shape of the tree will start by expanding the left-side until it expands the 1 call to -1 and -3.  These will return False to the _target sum_ = 1 call.  This will return false to the canSum with (3) as the _target sum_ and have right branch value of -1.  This will return false to the canSum with (5) as the _target sum_ and this will bubble up all the way to the top of the initial canSum call with _target sum_ being 11.  The right branch will be 7, which would have been the left branch of the call two levels down ( 11 -> 9 -> 7).  This has already been explored and discovered to be a non-fruitful subtree to expand.  Thus, the canSum ultimately returns false.  However, the more important element to see is that when you look at each level of the now fully branched tree, you can see that there is always 2 branches at every level.  11 branches to 9 and 7, 9 branches to 7 and 5 and so on and so forth.  There will 6 levels, *m* , and 2 branches, *n* ,  at every level 6 * 2 = 12.  Though this isn't m equaling 11 like the time complexity equation would suggest (11[levels] x 2[branches] = 24 calls), when dealing with large numbers than this, the difference in value is considered trivial.  We can never really get m to equal 11 in practical terms, but it works as a theoretical limit.\n\n[6]\nOne can inductively expand the previous example to see that branches of 3 or 4, or even more, will produce 1 x n(branches) at every level.  Thus m levels will produce m x 1 x n, or m x n, recursive *calls* to canSum.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgykiYwmoC-QKXwrl614AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-13T19:47:14Z", "author": "Girava | \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dc0\u0dcf", "text": "For the space complexity, why don't you consider the size of the cache(memo)?  \ud83d\ude44", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyDzmugiHW-TvgJSQF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-13T18:13:39Z", "author": "aketilius", "text": "Minor comment: in gridTraveler the property gridTraveler(m,n) = gridTraveler(n,m) hasn't been used in memoization", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugyt0n-VYo-eX4usSIt4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-13T18:12:06Z", "author": "aketilius", "text": "Very interesting video!

The counting of the height of a tree starts at level 0.  The height usually represents the *depth* that you are going 'down' the tree (or 'up', depending on how you want to visually represent the tree); so, technically the branch section is where you actually count the 'levels'.  The height, starting from a 0 counter, helps you to determine the maximal number of nodes that exist at a given 'depth' of a tree given the max branches, *n* , and the depth, *m* .\n\nSo, in the case of your initial question, the technical answer is 3.    The reason being is that, even though the values of the gridTraveler are 2 and 3, we have defined the end point, or desired point to be (1,1), because (0,0), (1,0) and (0,1) represent an abstractly impossible grid (i.e. we can't have a grid of 0 rows or 0 columns).  So the technical equation would be ( m - _m0_ ) + ( n - _n0_ ) ( with _m0_ and _n0_ representing our desired end point).  So, plugging in, we would get (2 - 1) + (3 - 1) = 1 + 2 = 3.  If we defined our endpoint at (0,0) instead, the tree he plotted out would have to go down *2* more levels in order to complete, and we would have 5 for m + n, because _m0_ and _n0_ would be both zero in the equation I used above.\n\nThe reason that he left it *m + n* is because big-O notation is usually concerned with general equations that give a reasonable ballpark for the time complexity of the algorithm, usually tending toward non-optimal/non-favorable conditions for the completion of the algorithm.  Making our endpoint (1,1), rather than (0,0) shaves off very little in the grand scheme of things, especially for large grids, and *n+m* is close enough.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwjxBEIYJxLZCFxehF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-12-06T00:37:47Z", "author": "Mart\u00edn D\u00edaz", "text": "Hi!
