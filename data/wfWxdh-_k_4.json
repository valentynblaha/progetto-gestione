I am up to lesson 22 and everything went extremely well up until this lesson.  I am getting an error with the binding lists in the tournament viewer form.  If i uncomment the line \"selectedMatchups.Clear();\" (line 83 on your video) the program works but the list doesn't get cleared so every time i switch between rounds the list just keeps adding entries.  if i leave the clear statement i get a null reference exception.  i have used the debugger like you said and it shows a null which is odd since i don't get nulls without the clear statement.  I have gone through the code so many times and made 100% sure all of the code i have matches what you have perfectly.  i think this is because of a quirk in the binding lists in newer versions of C# and/or VS.\n\nMy question to you is what version of Visual Studio did you create this project in?  I have noticed that Microsoft changed VS so you cannot change the language version it is completely dependent upon your version of .net..  Because of this its not an easy fix to just install a previous version of .net.  thoughts?  Once again thank you for this video i have learned so much but it is a little depressing that i cannot finish the project.", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Shawn A", "text": "@Alan Philpott if you have experience in SQL server you can discern what the stored procedures should be from looking at what the code is trying to do.  I did this and was able to get very close on most of them.  Even without SQL experience he shows you some of the SP's in the beginning of the video and you can pause the vid and get most of the information.  For the ones that he does not show just try to get close and when he gets to the places in the code where you actually begin calling the procedures he goes back over them to tweak or make sure they are right.  So my advice is to just soldier on and Tim eventually shows them all.  The SQL part went very well for me I didn't have any issues.\n\none tip though for working with SQL is to go to options and check the one that allows you to automatically drop and re-create tables when you make changes.

I have this same argument with other developers that only see it from their side of the fence. However, there is also agreement from many other devs who have to write any kind of extensive SQL queries.  I would hope you may agree that using generic keywords such as Date, Name, Description . etc. would be a bad practice in table design.

If you want more than one ID in a query, you have to alias it. I get that but that's not a big deal. If you have a problem with joins not being to the same name, that shouldn't be an issue since Id always refers to the PK where PersonId refers to the FK.

Tim does show you the Full Relationship Diagram as well as providing very descriptive names for said Stored Procedures.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that they are all based off of the exact same 1st SQL Script example with a few changes here and there with regards to Inner joins ( All of which is very descriptive in the names as to which parameter names to set and parse as well as the actual field names in each table and their data types to be used).\n\nIf this still confuses you, then I would recommend doing a beginners course to get you comfortable, confident and competent enough to be able to move through the material.

The focus of the course was on C#. I committed to doing all of the coding on screen. I wanted to do all of the SQL on screen as well but I quickly realized that to do so would have taken another 5-10 hours. That would have put this course well beyond the size I wanted it to be (it was already long). Add to that the issue of people coming to watch a C# video and ending up watching the first 15 hours before they ever really saw C#. That's not ideal. On the other hand, while SQL is a fairly necessary skill when it comes to working with C# if you are using data, I didn't want to assume everyone knew SQL. I had already designed every table on paper (and on video). I decided the best thing to do would be to show you how to create a table (which you could then follow the same pattern for the other tables), how to create a stored procedure (which you could then follow for the other stored procedures - you know what each is called, what inputs it has and what the output is so you have all of the relevant information to do it on your own), and then how to create a relationship (which isn't strictly necessary but since I showed off the relationships, I wanted to show you how to set one up). To top it all off, this entire application can work just fine without SQL at all. That also means you can skip some of the coding and cut down on the amount of time it takes to finish this course. Since the focus of this course is to teach you how to write C# code and not SQL scripts, I figured teaching you how to anyway but letting you then finish the work was a good compromise.\n\n\nI get that you want to see EVERYTHING on the screen, including all of SQL.

Following their own nature, they worship the devat\u0101s, practicing rituals meant to propitiate these celestial personalities.\"\n\neven the bhagvad Gita says that people are worshipping Devtas who are not to be worshipped, Only the Ultimate Lord who is unseen should be worshipped.\n\nI would like to say one more thing plzz stop believing the media. It's not true at all that every muslim wants to kill non muslims and blow up buildings and do suicide bombings. Our religion doesn't allow this. We fight only when someone fights us first. It is forbidden for us to destroy places of worship of other religions even if we rule the area. None of us is a terrorist.
