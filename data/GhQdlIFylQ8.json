There isn't a one of them where you don't hurl some personal insult. The worst thing I said was to either suggest you are affiliated with the channel (highly likely), or that you are a \"fanboy\". A third option I didn't mention is an unaffiliated troll, which I didn't mention because that IS negative. Of the options I gave (affiliated with channel either directly or indirectly, or a fanboy) neither option is inherently bad. I've been a fanboy of many things over the years, it just means that to are liable to be biased, and likely to squash legitimate critisim.\n\nI was frustrated at what I felt to be a very poorly paced video. Qualify however you want, but a \"Full course\" even \"for beginners\" suggests a full overview. The title would suggest a high level overview of all of C#. This is contraated with other videos that are lecture type videos, where I fully expect ad nauseum examples on the same subject. From a \"full course for beginners\", I would expect 1)general notion of what programing entails, maybe some strength/weakness comparison of the language 2) basic declaration of variables and data types (5 minutes or less). Overview of if/else/elsif with and/or etc. (Basic logic statements) Overview of loops and other iterative tools(while/for/etc), jumps etc, an overview of special variable types such as arrays. An basic overview (concept and syntax) of functions / methods. And maybe an overview of how to complie or build out the code so it is runable somewhere besides the testing environment.\n\nI myself am a beginner. I'm not by any means experianced. If you have the impression I'm some troll, here to scoff at others your mistaken. My only formal exposure to coding was from a class I took in high school, 20 some years ago where I tinkered with QBasic. But, even I can list the above off the top of my head. That is what I, AS A BEGINNER, would expect in a \"full course for beginners\". I am the target audience for this video. Someone that doesn't know a single programing language, who is looking to start getting exposed, and take up C#. The irony of having someone obviously more experianced than I, lecture me (a beginner) on how I don't properly appreciate the video because it is for beginners is not lost on me. That said, my frustrations stemmed from being 30-40 minutes into the video, and having listened to him go on for 10+ minutes on what a variable was. I did the math in my head....4 hour video, 30 minutes in and we are still talking about want a variable is. That is roughly 1/8th of the time of this video. Looking at the list of what I would expect in this video, and all the topics we need to cover, is 1/8th the runtime dedicated to what a variable is seem an appropriate use of time?\n\nIn my view, no. So I checked out, and commented on what I felt to be a waste of 30 minutes. \n\nIs that somehow a bizarre notion? If I was a the content creator, wouldn't I want to know about that? Your damn right I would. You say I'm fine to critisize, but literally all of your comments can be summed up as critisizing me for doing so lol. You keep saying I'm angry, or \"throwing a fit\", yet I'm not. I expressed my frustration days ago, out of my system, and have been trying to have a calm logical discussion since, yet each one of your comments ends in some denegrating remark\n\nI'm sure this video is perfect for a lot of people, more power to them and you (or your partner). Im not disparaging anyone for thinking the video is great, nor do I wish any illwill to the creator. I simply was conveying my reaction. Even if you think my reaction was Ill-founded, or based in ignorance, it is a reaction I'm sure the creator would like to avoid non-the-less. Burying ones head in the sand is unlikely to have the desired outcome. Or, maybe I'm just completely off base, in which case, ok, fair enough. To be fair, much of my frustration is alleviated by knowing there are sections I can jump to. I wasn't aware until you pointed it out. (I'm not a huge YouTuber, and I often find this only in hindsight, thanks for pointing it out, I may give the video another try with this in mind). Although that doesn't remove the room for improvement for the creator right? How was it I didn't know. Saying I'm just stupid and ignorant may be statisfying, but ultimately unhelpful. Perhaps \"I should start the video by highlighting the feature, and perhaps start each segment with a title screen (perhaps with a quick summery of whats to be covered) to reinforce the idea throughout the video. Again, 100 ways my comments can be taken to make a better product. \n\nTrying to denegrate people for expressing critisism, is ultimately a losing proposition. Your better off saying, \"I think this critisism is unfounded, because of 1/2/3, but if it were legit, how would I improve.\"\n\nAnyway, I'm not trying to argue, and I'm not trying to win some dumb comment argument, we all know how that goes.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Calactic", "text": "@E C I don't think you realize, learning C# takes months to learn, no video on YouTube can make you understand all it's concepts. The title is \"Full course\" BUT ALSO \"For beginners\", having the title as a \"COMPLETE course for beginners\" gives off the same effect, I've never said there's a distinction between the two and you've clearly missed my point. With this title you should expect the video to go into detail with key, core concepts as if this is the first time anyone is learning C# or any other programming language for that matter. Do you honestly link \"Beginner\" and \"Complexity\" in your head? You blatantly said this video was a complete course in your previous comment, when that is just not the case whatsoever. You might think these concepts are rather easy and common sense, but for many people they aren't. You seem like a well-spoken and intelligent person, but try to understand that everyone learns at a different pace, and the guy is giving ample time for everyone to keep up. He's clearly done a decent job seeing as the vast majority of comments are people thanking him. I really don't see why you are so frustrated with this guy spending a couple more minutes than necessary to ensure people get a clear and concise understanding of each segment in the video, especially when at a press of one button you can skip parts you deem too easy. That's the great thing about YouTube, you can skip things! The video description even has timestamps you can refer to if it truly bothers you that much. The guy didn't have to make this 4 hour video, but here you are, angry, because they spent a few minutes clarifying each topic. I've never said that free content, including this video, aren't open for criticism. Of course you are free to criticize anything you see fit, but doing it under a fit of rage because you find it easy is uncalled for.\n\nTell me, which method to learn is more effective: Have the teacher explain the concepts in detail in a clear and concise manner, or just have the teacher to just brush over the concept and having you rewind and hear the same thing over and over again, as if listening to the limited explanation repeatedly will somehow eventually give you clarity? By your previous comment you state the latter is more effective. How is pressing one button to skip a segment in a video of any inconvenience to you?\n\nAlso to outright assume that I'm the owner of the channel in a different account would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Have a glimpse at my channel and it's content and see if it pertains to this channels content whatsoever. \n\nAll in all I think your frustration is completely unwarranted, and I'm here saying why I think so. Yet here you are being a hypocrite, telling me to accept criticism and hurdling infantile remarks at me calling me a \"fan-boy\" or the actual channel owner on an alternate account trying to perform some act of upholding reputation for a channel with 4.7 million subscribers on a 3 year old video. You're telling me to accept criticism? Okay, great, I do.

Gotta love people that rant about critiquing something/someone, by......critiquing someone. Again, I'm kinda giving the comment a pass, because it's obviously coming from the overly defensive creator (or fanboy). Is what it is. But constructive critisim is never bad. So, in that vain....\n\nMy constructive critisim was, phrased less harshly :\n\nTighten up the video. Trim the fat. Ever been to a 3 hour movie, and leave saying \"that would have been a great 2 hour movie\"? If the intent is to have people jump around, then start with an index / TOC, so people know what they would be skipping. I would gladly skip \"what is a variable\" but if he is just talking about \"variables\" ret large, I donno....I don't want to miss something. Also, I will be honest I didn't even notice the sections. That would have been helpful. You could jump down my throat about that, or, realize not everyone camps on YouTube, and maybe it would have been helpful to highlight how the video was indexed, and not assume people will realize it.\n\nYour critisms :\nBefore commenting, take a few moments to survey the landscape. Is there something you missed? Maybe your critisms, while they feel quite valid, are less applicable than you may first presume.\n\nAgain, no good critisms goes to waste, but the overt attempt to shout down critique is completely uncalled for", "likes": 0}, {"author": "E C", "text": "@Calactic lol, the title of the video is, \"Full course for beginners\", and the video is over 4 hours, which itself implies some level of complexity.\n\nI'm sorry, is this a semantic argument, where in your making a long winded distinction between \"full\" and \"complete\"? Really?\n\nIt would be valid to point out I only watched for 30 minutes (which I feel is ample time to give the video a fair shot). Maybe at 45/1hr it takes off. Maybe I'll give it another shot. But, instead of jumping in with both feet to try to bash down critisim (I suspect this account is actually affiliated with the channel, despite the predictive forthcoming denial), maybe take a moment to appreciate someone else's perspective. I guarantee anyone watching this video knows what a variable is. I asked my wife, who has never programmed in her life what she thought, and she found it rediculous, and knew exactly what a variable is. \n\nMy critisism was simple, and valid, trim the fat. There is no need to pontificate on simple concepts, especially when we can pause and rewind.  \n\nNo fan-boyism / stealth supporting your own channel required. Just take it with a grain of salt, and move on.\n\nPs. Based on what I saw I wouldn't think of paying for the content. Also, the implication that YouTube viewers should get down on their knees and thank the creators for their content is rather tiresome. I support creators I feel are outstanding on Patreon, or with other forms of direct support, including jumping onto their platforms. Other YouTube's monetize their content I'm any number of ways, from ad revenue, to sponsorships, to them pulling people into another echo system (ie. Their own website). I've supported many such creators in every one of the above ways. By your standard, we shouldn't be able to critique a news commentator, or tv show because, after all, its \"free\". \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44.\n\nPut on your big boy pants, man up, take the critisism in stride, it will only improve the channel.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Calactic", "text": "It's not a complete course you thickhead.

In programming this is the fastest way to learn because you'll only learn it once you did it yourself independently anyway.

The hardest part for programming beginners is splitting their huge seemingly unsolvable problem into small actually managable problems that can easily be googled. Also for learning, don't try to code efficient. Try to do only one operation per line when you are still learning. That helps you splitting your problems.

I went to WSU and if I needed a book that was only available at like Stanford, they'd go and get it to me in a couple days free of charge, highly recommend if you're an independent learner, because that's kind of what people forget about.

You can use this to your advantage. We all think in different ways and sometimes the way you will understand some information, is not the same way another person will. If that other person, is the person explaining it to you, it can be difficult to understand the information. If this happens during your studies, take the keywords or titles and look them up online. Don't bang your head against brick walls, trying to understand one explanation of a concept. Find another resource that will explain it differently. Once you find one that makes sense, the other ways of explaining it will make more sense too. You can use this to double check you have understood correctly. If you cannot go back to other explanations and understand them, it is a sign you have still not fully understood a concept or that the other resource you found is incorrect. That can happen online. Once you fully understand a concept you will be able to follow different explanations of it, even if it's not one that explains it the way you would.

But most important try to code daily, even if it is a few lines of code. Coding is a matter of endurance, not speed. So don't get discouraged because you didn't understand today. Perhaps tomorrow you will understand it. Don't get mad because your code didn't compile, research instead.\n\nIf c# turns out to be too hard, perhaps learn javascript or python which are WAY easier to learn, and don't listen to all the py haters that say that you shouldn't start with python or the people that say that you need to learn c, c++ or c# as a first language. Everybody is different, everybody learns at a different rate, and not everybody is meant to program in c or the likes of it.\n\nKeep on coding man, it's really frustrating at first, but then it's even more frustrating hahahaha in the end its as rewarding as hard to learn.

After this, with this being what I mean by changing the index, it would turn that \"e\" into a \"z\", or possibly multiple characters, turning the e into the word \"letter\" or something. I wanted to make a simple encryption and decryption system that would turn an \"a\" into \"01\", an \"e\" into a \"05\" and a \"y\" into a \"25\".

I started 2 months before quarantine, but when it came, I could really get into it. I really like programming and it helps me in school though, for example I made unit converter on physics, or our IT teacher adviced me to create some game. And which other language should I use than C# and Unity, so I created classic tetris totally myself, and I didn't feel better in my life, than when I did testing and everything worked. In my country (Czech Republic) only way to start with programming was to wait three years until I could choose between Programming, Nature sciences or Russian language, so I went on YouTube, so I really practiced English (often with Indian accent :D) (sorry for mistakes btw).
