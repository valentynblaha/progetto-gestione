Seems like an error in your statement to me.  Also, the sentence construction is wrong.  \"If you recall, idempotence is...\".  That is the wrong use of an if statement.  Idempotence is not what it is as a result of us recalling what it is.  For example, if someone didn't recall what it is, idempotence is still the exact same thing.  Our recollection or not of it has nothing to do with what it actually is. A XOR B is true if exactly one of A,B is true but NOT both, so if P is true, P XOR P is false.  It is not clear if you meant can apply ANY binary operator or SOME binary operator for idempotence.\n\nHere is another example of a misuse of the word if...  if you drink milk, you will die.  This is generally false because many people have been known to drink milk and not die as a result of it.  This statement is however true:  All people that drink milk will die.  This is because the drinking of milk is not directly linked with the death of that person.  Since all people eventually die, we can substitute just about anything such as all people that take vitamin supplements will die.  Also a true statement.

If you are going to tell a would be programmer about a set, you should be talking about arrays (or bits in a byte) as the programmer's equivalent of sets and how logic operations can be done with them. If a programmer hasn't learned about arrays they aren't a programmer. If you speak math at a rookie developer you are not speaking their language. This is math(s) for math(s). Most sets a programmer are going to deal with are strings, arrays of data, or doing database queries. SQL would be a far better visual application of what you are talking about so you could show how a query can do unions or doing a relational query and show the notions of left inner and outer joins, or right inner or outer joins, and show what you get when you do them.

You're trying to prove that sqrt(2) is irrational, but you glossed over/skipped/delayed some key points. First, it's easier if you assume that a and b are co-prime (they share no common factors besides 1) which means that a/b is irreducible. This needs to be stated as an assumption a the beginning, not thrown in in the middle/end.\n\nIt feels like your proof that \"a is even\" is back to front. I'd start with \"let a = 2k\" (a is even). \"a squared\" is therefore \"4 times k squared\" which is obviously also even. Starting with \"a squared = 2 times (2 times k squared)\" is a big leap to make, since this video is ostensibly for people who are wary about math.\n\nIn general, for this section, I'd start out with something like. \"We just discussed rational numbers. What about irrational numbers? Irrational numbers are ones that..... <fill in here>, such as the square root of 2. How do we know that the square root of 2 is irrational?
