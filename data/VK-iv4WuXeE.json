And this drops drastically to about 1/10 of work when you have lot of requirements for the frontend connected with additional logic and you are also writing unit tests for your frontend. You can spend many weeks on front end project not touching css. For example when you are responsible for api and store part of React app or you are tasked to write unit tests for previously untested app or just extend test coverage for existing big app. It once happened to me to work on Typescript OOP application which was using canvas to render things. No HTML and CSS for quite long, but lot of OOP :).", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Diomari M", "text": "Stop drinking your own pee.", "likes": 4}, {"author": "Game_Over", "text": "JavaScript is considered as a front end language and you can do sooooo much with it", "likes": 6}, {"author": "Matheus Felipe", "text": "You need to review your definitions about it. wake up..", "likes": 2}, {"author": "1godlessmonkey", "text": "There's no other statement that will make you look more like an amateur than the one you just typed.", "likes": 19}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bruh", "text": "Skinny jeans....oh god i would look like a chicken in them", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Gabriel Arazas", "text": "I very much agree on learning by immersion.
