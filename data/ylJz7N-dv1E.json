Have you ever lied (even a \u201cwhite\u201d lie)? (Revelation 21:8) Have you ever stolen anything (value is irrelevant and includes downloading or copying movies illegally)?  If you\u2019ve lusted, you\u2019ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)\n\nIf you\u2019ve hated someone, the Bible says you\u2019re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you\u2019ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell.
