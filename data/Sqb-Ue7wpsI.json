I fixed it almost 24 hours later (See my reply to this comment for details) Here is the original issue for anyone else running into the same thing:\nWhen I play the game, the weapons don't appear on the screen. This started after I changed my FOV axis by accident. \nBefore pressing play, if I view the \"Game\" window, the weapons appear on the screen, but when I load into the game they aren't visible. After pressing play, then ending the game to continue editing, the weapons suddenly stop being visible in the \"Game\" window as well. If I change anything in the Camera component of the FP Camera, then the weapons reappear, but again only in the \"Game\" window. They then disappear again when I hit Play.\nThis issue may be a bug from the newest version of Unity, or something, since the FOV axis option wasn't available in the version showed in this video. Or maybe it's something simple that I just don't understand. \nThis is especially frustrating because I foolishly kept going through the tutorial. I'm now over 2 hours in, and was just starting on animating the weapons... but the animations are either not happening or are invisible when they do.", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxZ-9lgV7b_od3UlWB4AaABAg.99ffeD8xh019AVlgIMNHo0", "publishedAt": "2020-06-29T22:13:41Z", "author": "Kristiyan Ivanov", "text": "William Bosley The problem was that it wasn't linked. \u0445)", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxZ-9lgV7b_od3UlWB4AaABAg.99ffeD8xh019AVAVRqi0RN", "publishedAt": "2020-06-29T16:40:01Z", "author": "Will Forge", "text": "@Kristiyan Ivanov did my solution not help?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxZ-9lgV7b_od3UlWB4AaABAg.99ffeD8xh019AUYK8iOXXo", "publishedAt": "2020-06-29T10:48:57Z", "author": "Kristiyan Ivanov", "text": "My animations don't work, I checked everything...", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgxZ-9lgV7b_od3UlWB4AaABAg.99ffeD8xh0199i7rxvDY6A", "publishedAt": "2020-06-10T06:14:59Z", "author": "Will Forge", "text": "So it turns out that when you have multiple cameras, you need to force them to render in the correct order. This is the \"Depth\" field in the \"Camera\" component of each Camera object. The lower the number, the higher the priority of that camera. Since both of my cameras were set to 0, Unity had to decide which was on top, and I guess it chose the one tagged as \"Main Camera\". \nNow, in the video, Free Code Camp had his main camera set to -1. I don't know how mine wasn't, maybe it's defaulted to 0 after an update to Unity, or something. Or maybe I accidentally changed it? I don't know. Maybe I could start a new project just to see if it was default or my mistake, but I kinda don't care now that it's fixed. I left my main camera at 0, and put my FP Camera at 1. \nProblem solved. \nEnd of line.", "likes": 2}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz0Q-0Z5JKLZEi9uq94AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2020-06-09T02:36:42Z", "author": "Arun Kumar", "text": "Hi!
