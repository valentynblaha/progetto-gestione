I fixed it almost 24 hours later (See my reply to this comment for details) Here is the original issue for anyone else running into the same thing:\nWhen I play the game, the weapons don't appear on the screen. This started after I changed my FOV axis by accident. \nBefore pressing play, if I view the \"Game\" window, the weapons appear on the screen, but when I load into the game they aren't visible. After pressing play, then ending the game to continue editing, the weapons suddenly stop being visible in the \"Game\" window as well. If I change anything in the Camera component of the FP Camera, then the weapons reappear, but again only in the \"Game\" window. They then disappear again when I hit Play.\nThis issue may be a bug from the newest version of Unity, or something, since the FOV axis option wasn't available in the version showed in this video. Or maybe it's something simple that I just don't understand. \nThis is especially frustrating because I foolishly kept going through the tutorial.

Since both of my cameras were set to 0, Unity had to decide which was on top, and I guess it chose the one tagged as \"Main Camera\". \nNow, in the video, Free Code Camp had his main camera set to -1. I don't know how mine wasn't, maybe it's defaulted to 0 after an update to Unity, or something. Or maybe I accidentally changed it? I don't know. Maybe I could start a new project just to see if it was default or my mistake, but I kinda don't care now that it's fixed.
