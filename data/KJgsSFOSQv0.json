Therefore, you would give your friend your house's address (a pointer), so they can locate it easily.\n\nNow, let's put it to proper terms.\n\nC wants to know what the variable you're referring to is.

The order the functions are defined in doesn't matter. What matters is that the caller knows the callee exists and how to use it, so that the compiler can warn you if you do something screwy, and you don't do that by defining them in a specific order, you do that by declaring the function, same as you declare a variable. It would have been better if you just introduced function prototypes alongside non-void functions. I hope that when you get to structs, you also talk about how you can declare a struct type early, and that when you introduce headers, you also introduce include guards. Because it's better to just tell people how to do it right than saying anything that leads to \"be careful of the order\". No, the only time order matters is in sequences, like array definitions, function bodies, enumerators, that sort of stuff. The order of function definitions and header includes should never matter. If it does, you have made an error, and the compiler is probably screaming warnings at you. Listen to your compiler \ud83d\ude0c.\n\nThat said, I always put main at the bottom of its file as a matter of style, because that's typically where main is.

Say you're implementing a dynamic dispatch pattern. The *bold* stuff is not necessary if you have a header file, as you can see they're duplicates, although you may still want to do it for static functions. I've taken to putting static stuff in their own file that gets included. Libraries tend to use the naming convention xfilename dot c for those, but I don't like how it shoves them to the end of the file listing, so I've taken to naming them filename dot static dot c. I'm using \"dot\" because if I don't, youtube will think I'm posting links and shadowban me from commenting (it's happened too many times to be a coincidence).

The video seems to be a compilation of several videos. However, I recommend that you don't. Avoid scanf and fgets and ESPECIALLY avoid gets. These functions do not behave in the way that you want them to and have bizarre semantics.\n\nfgets for example includes the newline in the buffer (the one you pass in when calling), which is stupid, but not even the worst of it. If the user overflows fgets, the excess that doesn't get written to the buffer STAYS in stdin's buffer and will be available immediately to the next call to fgets. While this sounds reasonable in theory, it actually makes no sense, because the second call will suck up garbage from the last call and the user won't get a clean slate. In other words, the user is ignored and it just ASSUMES that the excess garbage was what was intended. It's impossible to distinguish between this and actual user input, because stdin is buffered. The buffer isn't sent to stdin until you hit enter.\n\ngets is just dangerous, don't even think about using it.\n\nI recommend doing your own line parsing\n\n    size_t\r\n    read_line(char *buffer, size_t bufsz)\r\n    {\r\n        int ch;\r\n        char *bufp = buffer;\r\n\r\n        if(ferror(stdin) || feof(stdin))\r\n            return 0;\r\n\r\n        while((ch = getchar()) != EOF && ch != '\\n')\r\n            if((size_t)(bufp - buffer) < bufsz)\r\n                *bufp++ = ch;\r\n\r\n        return (size_t)(bufp - buffer);\r\n    }\n\nLike fgets, this function takes a buffer and a size. Unlike fgets, this function does not bother with null terminators, does not include the newline in the buffer, and it throws away the excess to guarantee that every call actually prompts the user (it consumes the entire line and only stores what will fit given the size). The function returns the number of characters written to the buffer and is very un-complicated, so here's one way you could use it:\n\nsize_t nread;\nchar buffer[11];\n\nnread = read_line(buffer, 10);\nbuffer[nread] = '\\0';\n\nAnd that's it. Just like that, you have a safe, sane, null-terminated buffer containing only what you care about.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Braden Best", "text": "The case against fgets(buffer, size, file):\n\nFor one, you should just never use `gets(buffer)`. This function is mentioned in the fgets man page, it is extremely dangerous because it does not bounds check, so if the user enters more characters than the buffer can hold, undefined behavior occurs. As for fgets, it also does not handle excess input in what I would consider a reasonable way. fgets will cut off at one less than the buffer size (to insert a null terminator), but after that, another call to fgets MAY pull input from the file, or MAY pull input from whatever was buffered from the file. In other words, there is no clear division of lines. If you create two [10] buffers, call fgets with both of them and type \"Hello World\" into the prompt, _you will only get prompted once!_ The first buffer will contain \"Hello Wor\\0\", and the second will contain \"ld\\n\\0\". This may not be what you want. And the insertion of the newline into the buffer almost certainly isn't what you want.\n\nscanf is janky in similar ways, and every time I've ever seen it in a program, the program's input handling was janky.\n\nThere's also getline(bufferptr, sizeptr, file), which is a POSIX extension and is not actually part of the C standard library. This function is a little more complex.\n\n    char *buffer = NULL;\n    size_t bufsz;\n    getline(&buffer, &bufsz, stdin);\n    ...\n    free(buffer);\n\nAnd this function is closer to being sane. It does include the newline, which is dumb, but it creates an internal buffer and sets the buffer pointer and size for you, reading the entire line.\n\nBut there is one problem: it's an extension.\n\nAll in all, if you want polished and robust input handling, you have to do it yourself. Decide whether you need to handle input per-character or per-line. If it's per-character, use a [4096] buffer with fread. read in 4096 bytes at a time until fread returns < 4096. For per-line, I've actually written a function:\n\n    size_t\r\n    read_line(char *buffer, size_t bufsz)\r\n    {\r\n        int ch;\r\n        char *bufp = buffer;\r\n\r\n        if(ferror(stdin) || feof(stdin))\r\n            return 0;\r\n\r\n        while((ch = getchar()) != EOF && ch != '\\n')\r\n            if((size_t)(bufp - buffer) < bufsz)\r\n                *bufp++ = ch;\n\r\n        return (size_t)(bufp - buffer);\r\n    }\n\nThis function does a multitude of things. It takes a buffer and a size and fills the buffer with at most size bytes, returning the number of characters written to the buffer. Excess bytes are discarded into a black hole and never seen again, so to reuse that example from earlier about having two [10] buffers and entering \"Hello World\", if you do that, the first call will fill the buffer with \"Hello Worl\" (with a return value of 10), but the second call will have nothing and will wait for the user to enter more input. The \"d\" was thrown away, considered garbage. EOF and I/O errors cause a return value of 0, and the buffer never contains a newline.\n\nThe function has many uses. Here's a press enter to continue prompt implemented using read_line:\n\n    fputs(\"Press Enter to continue.\", stdout);\n    read_line(NULL, 0);\n\nThe prompt will \"eat\" any characters you type so that they don't \"leak\" into other parts of the program, until you hit enter. I usually put that in a macro or function void waitcontinue(void)\n\nThe other more general use:\n\n    char buffer[32];\n    size_t nread;\n\n    fputs(\"Enter some text > \", stdout);\n    nread = read_line(buffer, 32);\n\n    if(feof(stdin))\n        puts(\"Received EOF. Quit.\");\n\n    printf(\"Received input: '%.*s'\\n\", nread, buffer);\n\nIn my programs, I have them quit on EOF and interpret empty lines (read_line returns 0 and feof returns 0) as cancel.\n\nThe best part is that it's not a complicated function at all. The loop goes until it hits an eof or newline and only adds characters to the buffer if there's space for them. The ferror and feof check are there because sometimes (like with mingw) getchar will continue prompting stdin for input after having received an EOF. This is a bug in mingw and in replit's environment, so the check guarantees that the function behaves as expected. Maybe there IS a function in libc that does what this function does, but if there is, I've yet to find it.\n\nsome other useful functions:\n\n    int\n    clamp(int value, int min, int max)\n    {\n        if(value < min)\n            return min;\n\n        if(value > max)\n            return max;\n\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    void\n    putsv(char const **strings)\n    {\n        for(int i = 0; strings[i] != NULL; ++i)\n            puts(strings[i]);\n    }\n\nclamp is obvious. putsv (put string vector, vector being C terminology for arrays, in case you ever wondered if the v in argv stood for anything) takes a NULL-terminated array of strings and plops them all out to stdout. It's better than calling printf over and over again (or worse: a single giant call to printf). Just put the data all in one place.", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Bashir Jeego", "text": "am in my first semmester thank u so much u have helped me so much thanks again", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tony $o$a", "text": "CodeBlocks doesn't work in Big Sur 11.6!

Basically I'm aware if you recognize your buttons by name and use them by their name your students would be aware of its name being important and include in your introduction that each icon (then inform everyone of the purpose of an icon to differentiate the difference between an icon and an image (which is: an image is a visual example of an idea. An icon is a artists creation of a representation of a recognizable artestaries implementation of the currently standard of the recognizable \"character\" of an artists piece of art that you can recognize anytime you see it to have an idea of what to expect from its known details of itsself. So when people make icons in their apps, the expectations will be met with adaption of possabilities of features and anything that could possibly be helpful in making the use of all of the fundamentals and so forth to be capable of being easier and better for us to completely ensure our works are progressive. \n\nI found the name of the button in your video by hovering my pointer [that i guided with a mouse] over the icon and the developer of that program was aware to the importance to have a pointer that is over a button to display the buttons name that his important detail was possibly more difficult to write into his gift to us so we can apply our efforts to include the use of his helpfulness to utilize their features if possible to educate at the right time. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Basically i would prefer if you used the names of each button in the program after your explenation to include the explenation of the features (buttons/drop down menus) correct naming.

The guess limit is executed with way too many extra steps. Why check for whether the user has reached the limit in an if statement when you can just do it in the while loop condition itself? Also, there's no need for the out of guesses variable since you can just check if the guess count is under the limit inside the while loop's condition without any such variable. You also only need either a limit or a guess number as you can specify the number where the loop ends in the loop condition itself, making one of those unnecessary.\n\nWell, we are all only human at the end of the day and one imperfection in the tutorial isn't a major issue anyway.

I know java internally stores strings as length followed by the actual string, unlike languages like C that just just have a variable length string that gets terminated with the character value of 0 (\"\\0\" if you want to use an escape sequence to test it in C,C++,etc). I think java's strings are also 2bytes wide, while C doesn't specify encoding (usually ends up being utf8 these days, since it is supposed to be 1 byte per char). Java does alot of crazy things under the hood \"for efficiency\" but they are anything but. Certainly makes java easier to develop (not develop in), though. Not that it matters too much: java's constantly changing how it does all this internally, at least according to them. \n\nI remember when i was reading python i ended up nope-ing out, something about implicit code or something. I remember it was when i got to functions. I tried to find it again and not so easy, but i can see another thing that quickly annoyed me: the lack of semi-colons or some other type of intuitive delimiter for functions, whiles, etc. The use of whitespace can quickly turn into a problem depending on environment. While semicolons were certainly harder to keep track of, IDEs now actually make it easier to keep track of matching.

If you want to allocate memory on the heap rather than the stack, you\u2019ll need a pointer to point to that memory location so that you could access it. Dynamic memory allocating is useful when you need to allocate memory at runtime, rather than at compile time. Stack allocated memory will be freed when the variable goes out-of-scope, but heap allocated memory must be manually freed.\n \nAnother use of pointers is to avoid copying objects. If a function needs an object that is rather large, passing it by value could impact the performance. Instead, you can pass it by pointer.\n \nPointers can also be used for optional function parameters. C doesn\u2019t really have a way to have optional parameters. To make an optional parameter, you can use macros, or you can use a pointer. The function can just check if the pointer is NULL, and if it is it can ignore it.\n \nPointers can also be used to write data at a specific memory address. You may have a function that returns some data, but you might also want it to give you some additional information, maybe optionally. You can do this by having the function take in a pointer, then it can just write that data at that memory address. If you want it to be optional, the function can check if it is not NULL before writing to it.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "rushikesh kuruba", "text": "It is very good", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rafiq Razak", "text": "me after watching the first part: \n\nKnowledge\nIs\nPower", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"author": "Rafiq Razak", "text": "@I love Quake did i say its funny?", "likes": 0}, {"author": "I love Quake", "text": "What's so funny about this?", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "JuniGear X", "text": "Thank you, it is very useful", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Mahjabin Oyshi", "text": "My code block is not opening...it says \u2018Entry point not found\u2019..what should I do now???plzzzzz tell me", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "You mean the IDE isn\u2019t opening?

You can pass it as an array, you just need to make it const:\n\n    void sayHi(const char name[]);\n \nAlso, passing an array is the same thing as passing a pointer. Arrays are just pointers to sequential data (they also contain some additional data, like the size), and when you pass one as a parameter, it decays into a pointer. So passing the strings as a char array is the same thing as passing it as a pointer:\n \n    void sayHi(const char *name);\n \nAlso, you should avoid forward declaring functions with unspecified parameters. If a function takes in no parameters, put void in the parameter list:\n \n    void foo(void);\n \nIf the function does take in parameters, specify them:\n \n    void foo(int a, float b);\n \nBy having an empty argument list, you are saying that the function has unspecified parameters.

Everything makes sense I just don't see why pointers are important", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Artem Katerynych", "text": "There are many uses of pointers in C. Here is a few that I can think of.\n \nOne use of pointers is to avoid copying data. If you have a large variable, copying it could be bad for performance. Instead, you can just pass it by pointer and the function can then just dereference it to access the data.\n \nAnother use of pointers is for writing data to a specific memory address. You can simply pass a pointer to the function, and it can then write data to that memory address.\n\nPointers are also needed for dynamic memory allocation. If you want to allocate memory on the heap rather than the stack, you will need to store the memory address of your allocated memory so that you can access that memory and later free that memory when it is no longer needed.\n \nPointers are also great for optional function parameters. Since C doesn\u2019t have something like std::optional, you can just use pointers instead. If you don\u2019t want to pass certain data, you can just pass NULL. The function can then check if the pointer is pointing to a valid memory address. If not, it can just ignore it.\n \nAnother use of pointers are arrays.

I'd set max to be the first element, then I'd iterate through all the array elements and compare them to max. If a number is larger than max, set max to the new number.

C is not object oriented programming language and String in many languages is a class which object contains info like length, also it has associated methods like replace some characters etc. In C that \"string\" is just a pointer to a memory containing specific characters. Note that in C string has no attached length info so to know where it ends computer puts null terminator at the end of that memory (so if you're making a string yourself you need to know to allocate length + 1 memory and to put '\\0' at the end). It's also worth noting that in C and in many others languages char is just one byte. It's ideal for ASCII but if you want to use UTF-8 or something like that you might need more memory. And another note, despite char being named char just like character it doesn't mean it's just character. It can be used to represent text but it can also be used to store a binary number. In case of signed char it can hold 256 values from -127 to 127 and in case of unsigned char it can store also 256 values from 0 to 255.", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rosso Corsa", "text": "OMOOMMOMOMOMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Rajesh Gour", "text": "The best video on u tube yet for beginners\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Daniel Kuva", "text": "Uuuuuhhhhhh, my code is not executing into anything. help?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "Daniel Kuva", "text": "sorry, i see you are using Windows and i am on Mac. when you execute things your command prompt comes up. now, when i execute things my terminal comes up but the code is not executed.... i must be missing something :(", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Ujjal Chowdhury", "text": "What are the steps to become a professional C programmer?

You used sqrt,pow without including <math.h> and linking against -lm (latter is done automatically with clang (mac,llvm))\n2.) scanf(\"%s\") is inherently dangerous as it causes buffer overflows use scanf(\"%19s\") for a char buf[20]\n3.) sayHi works without function prototype (maybe a visual c thing?) but you mention/show in the next section that it is needed\n4.) Using int result; works here but may be uninitialized in larger logic, initialize it please\n5.) Why break in switch is needed is rather sloppy explained\n6.) strcpy needs #include <string.h> may mention strncpy\n7.) Post-, preincrement not explained, better use always i +=1; to be safe for beginners\n8.) while (guess != secretNumber) guess is uninitialized here, leads to undefined behaviour -> may win without doing anything as guess is randomly already 5, may use do while\n9.) Maybe use _Bool or bool from stdbool.h (But it seems you're teaching ANSI/C90)\n10.) In for-loop chapter you're using C++ style comments, but never explained them.

That '\\0' is a null terminator and it's there to notify the computer that it's end of the string. If there were no terminator (for ex. you'll be making string from scratch with malloc or something and you forget to put it) the computer will just continue reading the memory, at least it will try to do so, because in that situation operating system can just throw \"Memory access violation\" in your face, but if not, you'll just see a region of memory in your console.

Trust me! As for the rest, C/C++ are more low-level programming languages that are actually quite very advanced, && not @ all beginner friendly. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer; useful & I'd recommend learning it after having broad knowledge of Networking like say, CCNA. Java is awesome!!! Then we come to: THE WEB!
