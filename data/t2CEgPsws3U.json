Why do you create the methods inside the constructor function instead of using prototype?  As a 'class', the Stack function shouldn't be as general as possible? I mean, maybe you want to create different instances of the Stack constructor function, several stacks, (like 'yourStack', 'herStack' and so on and so for)  but for any reason you may not want all of them to have these methods. And I have one more question, is there a way to implement push, pop and peek without using the buildt in Array Object methods? I mean, to push withoud using push(); to pop without using pop()... and in the remove method, is there some way to remove the element without using the keyword 'delete'.\nSorry, tons of questions.

Using the min/max height method gives you wrong results on certain trees. The height of a node is considered the max-height of that node, and so for a tree to be balanced each nodes' left and right substree cannot have a height (max height) difference of more than 1.\n\nFor example, insert this in a tree in order (50, 40, 30, 45, 48, 100, 90, 120, 80, 95, 110, 130, 60)\nin this case the tree is actually balanced, but your min/max method will say its NOT. because the min height is 2 and max height is 4, which is WRONG.

You do not need to install JavaSript, your browser understands it. Your task is to \"explain\" the browser that it has to run your code. \n And there are a few other options:\n1. To try some of the code based on the examples from this video, you can open DevTools in Chrome go to the console and type your code there.  \n2. You can use any text editor and place your JavaScript code between <script> </script> tags and save a file as .html  and open the file with your browser. In this case, you can't use the console.log() to see the results, you will have to either pass this data to html elements or use alert() function. \n3. You can install node.js, save your code in .js file and run only JavaScript code by typing \"node [file name]\" and your results will be in the console.  If you want to work with HTML and CSS and manipulate the DOM,  you can use codepen.io or you can set up your own back-end part, for example, in node.js.
