I use Electron apps a lot and they work great for me. But I don't understand how he can praise PhoneGap. Every PhoneGap app I used was a complete mess, it is so much slower than native app, most of the time it doesn't even look and feel like native and ih has so many bugs and problems. If you want to build mobile apps I would advise to learn native development - yes it's harder but it's really worth it. If you don't want to learn native, at least use React Native or Flutter. They come close to the speed of native apps and they look & feel like one.
