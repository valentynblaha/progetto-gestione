It's a bit easier but It looks like all prefer that two steps method (open as BGR, then convert). Is something wrong with opening an image as gray. 2. Canny uses threshold1 and threshold2.

You all are putting so much effort and time in these videos. I think if you make the roadmaps videos like if you want to  become a android developer watch this playlist in which you can mention all the videos that are related to the android development. Yes I know that you already had created playlists but they are kinda incomplete and are not roadmaps videos. And one more suggestion make a playlist of roadmaps videos for different learning paths like you had created pytorch  and  tensorflow tutorials if they both are mentioned in a roadmap video of data scientist and a pdf in description as if anyonnes wants to print and want the learning steps so he/she can download the pdf. I hope you will like my suggestion. Even I follows your tutorials but i didn't know whether the tutorial is for my path or not and then after researching and learning my own I  find that you had made the tutorials but I was not able to identify that the tutorial is helpful or not. So if you do this it will save so much time and everyone will know what to do next.\nThanks For Reading My Suggestion :)", "likes": 59}, "replies": [{"id": "UgwS_5nmXun9FicseVV4AaABAg.9Fb1W7g5tez9FdCIQH8YE_", "publishedAt": "2020-11-04T11:25:51Z", "author": "Tech With Rushabh", "text": "@Mechtron 47 He is a great guy :)", "likes": 2}, {"id": "UgwS_5nmXun9FicseVV4AaABAg.9Fb1W7g5tez9FdBpnO4KT3", "publishedAt": "2020-11-04T11:21:49Z", "author": "Mechtron 47", "text": "@Tech With Rushabh Even I am learning c++ from him!", "likes": 1}, {"id": "UgwS_5nmXun9FicseVV4AaABAg.9Fb1W7g5tez9FdBcpCp-nD", "publishedAt": "2020-11-04T11:20:02Z", "author": "Tech With Rushabh", "text": "@Mechtron 47 Yea I know that would be cool.", "likes": 2}, {"id": "UgwS_5nmXun9FicseVV4AaABAg.9Fb1W7g5tez9FdAm-umVJ2", "publishedAt": "2020-11-04T11:12:33Z", "author": "Mechtron 47", "text": "@Tech With Rushabh Yes know that but they have more audience than Code With Harry.
