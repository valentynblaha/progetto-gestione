Yes I know that you already had created playlists but they are kinda incomplete and are not roadmaps videos. And one more suggestion make a playlist of roadmaps videos for different learning paths like you had created pytorch  and  tensorflow tutorials if they both are mentioned in a roadmap video of data scientist and a pdf in description as if anyonnes wants to print and want the learning steps so he/she can download the pdf. I hope you will like my suggestion. Even I follows your tutorials but i didn't know whether the tutorial is for my path or not and then after researching and learning my own I  find that you had made the tutorials but I was not able to identify that the tutorial is helpful or not.
