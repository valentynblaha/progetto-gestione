In the introducing section (like in 28:41) we have a gridsearch that contains a pipeline with the numeric features transformer. I guess it is the right way to data leakage, because in our pipeline we first transform all the numeric features in the entire dataset and straightly after that we start our model learning through the cross-validation process within the entirely transformed dataset. Our training sets, created during cv, contain previously standardized data, so the model \"knows\" something about the examples that are not in the training set and can predict better when process them in the prediction step.

Really apprecaite the thoroughness as it's really helping me nail down theses concepts.\n\nI do have to question something though, what's so wrong with the original dataset? I understand the racists concerns, but I think it should serve as a reminder of how silly our history actually is, and how far we've come?\n\nIt also highlights another very important topic in machine learning: Just because a feature is in a data set, doesn't mean that it needs to be part of the analytics or modeling. \n\nMoreover, part of AI explainability is to identify what features you were given to work with, and wich ones you decided to chose for your model. Therefore, having a feature like this is important so that we all learn to critically analyze the information we've been given, and help us understand which features should be used for modeling.\n\nI'm commenitng on here, as opposed to elsewhere, because it seems like this was something you found bad - and were very passionate about in the video. My personal view is that it should have been kept in the data set from scikit-learn, those of us who are serious about this stuff know how to \"drop columns\", and be fully tranparent in how we built our models - including the features used.\n\nTherefore, there is absolutely nothing to hide.\n\nAnyone who builds a model, tells you how well it perfomrs, but can't explain anything other than draw you a picture of how a nueral network works should never be trusted. AI and Machine Learning is science. Science must be transparent, repeatible and reproducible.\n\nIt should also serve as a reminder of history. Those who don't know about history tend to repeat it.
