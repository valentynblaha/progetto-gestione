Thank you.  I'm new to the web development field, and one video talked about needing to start using github. I watched over 30 different videos, explaining \"everything you need to know about Git and GitHub\" but NONE of them have been able to explain it, to a newbie, such as myself. This introductory playlist has taught me more than all 30 of those videos - combined. And NOW, having watched your video series, I can go back, and understand what all 30 of those videos even mean.
