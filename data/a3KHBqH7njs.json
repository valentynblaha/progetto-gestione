Though I think that instead of \"x\" the first variable name should've been \"propertyName\" -- just to make it more explicit and thus clear what's happening.  And then maybe go over the code with \"x\" afterwards just to show that it really doesn't matter what that first variable is called.\n\nSlightly more problematically, in the beginning, stating that \"'for...in' will loop through property names and 'for...of' will loop through property values\" can be confusing at first when compared to the later statement (beginning at around 2:15) that the former works on what is enumerable while the latter what is iterable.  In that vein, finally, I also thought that the later contrast between the two was good but felt just a bit rushed somehow.\n\nStill, overall a nice video for us beginners; thanks!", "likes": 11}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Arun Nagar", "text": "Very well explained \ud83d\ude42", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Climbers137", "text": "\"for in\" loops through innumerable properties, property \"names\" 0:05:\n--1:58-2:16, object defined properties\n--3:12, array numeric indexes & object defined properties\n\n\"for of\" loops through iterable objects (i.e. array, map, set), property \"values\" 0:08:\n--4:01-4:18, values in arrays", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Axel", "text": "perfect video :)", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041e\u043d\u0443\u0444\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0447\u0443\u043a", "text": "Dude you're best, and bearded, HAHAHA", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Md Rohim Sikder", "text": "is it your actual typing speed? or editing?", "likes": 17}, "replies": [{"author": "Avy", "text": "No, its fast forward, haven't you noticed the cursor blink?", "likes": 7}, {"author": "member?", "text": "editing", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Chester Copperpot", "text": "your videos are helping me with the \"WHY?\" .  thank you for these. :):)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Tom Ormiston", "text": "one way of remembering :     'i' n --> ob 'j' ect   [look visually similar]\nso the other must be :  off --> array\n\nOR  \"I want to get to know you  _in person_ \" if you know that person is normally best as an object ?", "likes": 5}, "replies": [{"author": "member?", "text": "yeah, very \"intuitive\" way", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "90AlmostFamous", "text": "just remember by this:\nfor (let index in Arr)  {\n    console.log(index   +   Arr[index] ); //gives fname beau\n}\nfor (let item of Arr)  {\n    console.log(item);     //gives 3,5,7\n}", "likes": 4}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Arvee -", "text": "feels like javaScript god made these videos :D", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "liu yu", "text": "why the `for of` can't output the `foo` value of the arr?
