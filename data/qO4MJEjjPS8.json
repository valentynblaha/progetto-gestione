There are always two main parts to problem solving in programming.  Solving it on paper and implementing it in code.  If you are able to simulate this problem on paper, implementing it shouldn't be too difficult.  If it is difficult to implement, it will just require more practice solving and implementing problems over time.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Breakpoint", "text": "out of curiosity, where is this even used in real life?", "likes": 4}, "replies": [{"author": "DeadInside", "text": "I don't know if it's considered real life (lol) but tag systems are used to prove the Turing-universality of the rule 110 cellular automaton", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Breakpoint", "text": "ok that is what I thought :) I couldn't see where this would be useful in real life, but a good mental exercise", "likes": 0}, {"author": "freeCodeCamp.org", "text": "I'd say these practice problems are more for improving your problem solving skills which are of course used daily when programming.", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "KozmicLuis", "text": "This is my recursive solution:\n\nconst collatz = (_, firstTwo, rest = '') =>\n  rest + { a: 'bc', b: 'a', c: 'aaa' }[firstTwo[0]]\n\nfunction tagSystem(tape) {\n  console.log(tape)\n  \n  if (tape.length > 1)\n    tagSystem(tape.replace(/^(\\w{2})(\\w*)/, collatz))\n}", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "/", "text": "or instead of using *>= 2* you could just use the condition *> 1*", "likes": 4}}]}
