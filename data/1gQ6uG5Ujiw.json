The Twitter API is specifically designed by and for Twitter. You could do something similar for Facebook, but the code would be different. The reason for going from a list to an array to a dataframe is dependent on what goals I happen to have for the data. For instance when I'm using a dataframe, this is due to the fact that I want to process and analyze the data, and Pandas dataframes are good at such things. \n\nI hope you found the video useful.
