It's interesting, I just LOVE binging on courses.

Otherwise it is pointless.  This allows me to take on an advanced course straight away, even if I don't retain everything, the most important thing is I will gain a map for what it looks like to implement the full features available to me.  I'll gain a framework and language to be able to google from to integrate that into the big problem I'm working on to solve.  If I started at beginner courses all the time and did things the slow way, it might actually take 10 times longer to realise that I shouldn't have even been using that tool in the first place for the problem I want to work on.

I still recommend going through the video completely because it gets a lot of the bigger points, but according to my friend, hooks make life super easy for some of these harder tasks. This video shows modifying state only through class-based components, and that seems to be the focus of the second half of the tutorial. Traditionally this is how it's supposed to be done, but now there are hooks in react which allow you to do it in functional components which are just easier to mess with in general. Also, his info on APIs is solid in this video but there now are implementations like Apollo that are designed for more modern applications. So overall, I recommend watching through the video still, but after, start learning about hooks and Apollo/GraphQL and hopefully that will make your life easier. Also, I have been using Next.js which is a framework based on the React.js library and it makes so many things so easy if you learn that too, but it's not necessary.

As an experienced developer who has always done back end stuff, this is my first foray into front end coding. Can anyone recommend a \"best of breed\" setup for a local development environment? That is, is there a \"standard\" that a lot of developers use? Perhaps an IDE? I've found dozens on the web, but before I waste my time doing something few people do, I'd like to get perspective from an experience React developer.
