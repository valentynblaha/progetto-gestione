I still recommend going through the video completely because it gets a lot of the bigger points, but according to my friend, hooks make life super easy for some of these harder tasks. This video shows modifying state only through class-based components, and that seems to be the focus of the second half of the tutorial. Traditionally this is how it's supposed to be done, but now there are hooks in react which allow you to do it in functional components which are just easier to mess with in general. Also, his info on APIs is solid in this video but there now are implementations like Apollo that are designed for more modern applications. So overall, I recommend watching through the video still, but after, start learning about hooks and Apollo/GraphQL and hopefully that will make your life easier. Also, I have been using Next.js which is a framework based on the React.js library and it makes so many things so easy if you learn that too, but it's not necessary.
