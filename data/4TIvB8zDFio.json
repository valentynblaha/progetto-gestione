But there is market for all skill sets and experience. Usually juniors can find easier jobs from local businesses, because they are cheaper and since you can talk face to face with the client, the connection is different. If you want foreign clients, well, build your experience with smaller projects and add it to your portfolio or CV, depending on if you have a personal website(which by the way, also helps). Don't forget to have a github account with the projects that you are working on, even if they are just tutorials from courses or youtube, still counts as something and that you  want to become a professional.The repositories don't have to be public, you can have them private and give access to technical people at interviews, if you don't want to share the code. Also one of the most important advice, don't give up if you fail to get a project, apply to multiple ones, research clients and don't stop learning. It's hard to get the ball rolling, after that it will roll by itself.
