I really enjoyed the learning process and liked features provided by Quasar a lot too. Planning to create more Quasar projects in near future. The app ran easily on web and electron.\nIn case of android only issue I found was Android API level 29 is required to be installed and by default API level 30 is installed in new Android Studio installation. After installing API 29(Android Q) from SDK manager the app ran smoothly on android as well.\nOnce thank you for making this tutorial.
