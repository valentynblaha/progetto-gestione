Also, as the video gets older it is important to note that there will be a number of issues you will run into.\n1) There is about an hour spent on styling using Bootstrap. The version used is outdated and some parts are deprecated so you will need to make adjustments.\n2) The Rails autogenerated pages for the Friends section is quite different than what is shown on the video\n3) There is not much explanation as to what is going on in when Rails autogenerates stuff so that we can somehow troubleshoot any errors we may be having.\n4) Ive ran into issues with destroying a friend, Sign in error.

Before we made the \"Index\" page our new home page (by calling the root method discussed at 38:37), the server processed calls to the Index page as GET requests. After we commented out GET 'home/index' and replaced it with ROOT 'home#index', our \"index\" page became accessible through a root call rather than a GET request.\n\nThe latest version of Ruby on Rails requires you to create a separate HTML template for all GET requests. The reason an error occurs when we attempt to load a new subpage (including any subpage with an address like localhost:3000/home/example) is that Ruby must perform a GET request to create this new page. However, our \"index\" page  is no longer in the request format as it has now become our homepage.\n\nTo solve this problem, refrain from commenting out GET 'home/index' on the routes.rb page.

Font size, it is waaay too big and the size actually creates more confusion. You have 1/3 of your screen not being used merely because you wanted a white advert behind your cam.\n2. Demonstrate good programming practices. I know you're trying to work quickly, but code formatting and indents are important... being a Python guy, you should know that.\n3. Keep security in mind... teaching insecure practices is not a good idea. For instance, having the current user's id as a hidden form field is a bad idea. A user could edit the form field's value and insert a friend associated with another user. Instead, get the current user id in the `create` method and use that when inserting the record.\n4. Keep performance in mind... rather than filtering query results in the view, change the query to only fetch friends of the current user.\n5. Instead of having a conditional to show a pseudo-homepage in the friends index, use the controller to render the appropriate view.\n6. \"~\" doesn't translate to \"root directory\" but rather the current user's home directory which would be `/home/<usesrname>` or `C:\\Users\\<username>` on Windows (assuming the OS is installed on C and the user paths have not been altered).\n7. Suggesting to not use a password on SSH keys is also not a good idea and they certainly are not \"superfluous.\" The passwords are an added security measure that protect your servers (or w/e the keys are for) from being physically stolen. If a hacker (remote or through in-person social engineering) were to ever gain access to your SSH keys, your servers' security would be compromised if there isn't a password on your keys.\n\nAs for why GitHub has changed the default branch from 'master' to 'main'... it's part of their effort to use more \"inclusive\" language. If you're insistent on using 'master', you can change your default branch name in your GitHub settings.", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyhTGOIampsJH1XKOR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-07-11T18:38:37Z", "author": "Collin Hart", "text": "Awesome video!

This would allow user 1 to add a friend to user 2\u2019s account if user 1 changed the friend[user_id] client-side. The @friend.nil? logic would only work if it is incorrect (being that its not incorrect at the time of running is where the problem lies, so it\u2019s sort of a logic flaw. Checking the parameter with the expected user in that method would fix that.

For folks working on Windows, just an FYI: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It makes the *entire* first section of this video go smooth as butter by comparison. WSL lets you run bash/zsh natively using an actual Linux kernel instead of relying on git bash. Doing it this way, you'll need to follow setup/installation steps recommended for linux users (i.e. install RVM and pull in ruby/rails through that so your ruby version is locked down. DON'T USE THE CANONICAL PACKAGE, it will very very likely be wildly outdated. Use RVM or rbenv or asdf or whatever flavor of version management catches your fancy)\nThat said, avoid developing baremetal in Windows. You're setting yourself up for headaches down the road. Sure, it can be done, but should you? Probably not if you can avoid it. At least not where Rails is concerned.
