In this talk by Beau Carnes, you will learn the theory of neural networks. Instead of teaching about a framework such as Karas or TensorFlow, Beau gives an overview of the methods behind those frameworks.\n\nFirst, he explaining the key concepts of deep learning.  Then, he live codes a neural network using Python without using any frameworks. This will help you understand the concepts at a deeper level.\n\n\ud83d\udc26 Beau Carnes on Twitter: https://twitter.com/carnesbeau\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Beau's Deep Learning course from Manning Publications: https://www.manning.com/livevideo/grokking-deep-learning-in-motion?a_aid=algmotion&a_bid=5d7bc0ba\n\nTalk given at Moscow PythonConf++ 2018.

I say the diagram is \"interesting\" because I don't want to be hasty and say it's wrong. I want to understand why the diagram is different from what I've learned (AI contains all of ML which contains all of DL). I've peaked inside Andrew Trask's book (Grokking Deep Learning) and found yet another variation of this diagram that allows for Machine Learning and Deep Learning that are not forms of Artificial Intelligence.
