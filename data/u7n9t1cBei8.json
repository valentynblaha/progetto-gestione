{"video": {"id": "u7n9t1cBei8", "title": "Theory of Neural Networks - Deep Learning Without Frameworks", "description": "Finally understand how deep learning and neural networks actually work. In this talk by Beau Carnes, you will learn the theory of neural networks. Instead of teaching about a framework such as Karas or TensorFlow, Beau gives an overview of the methods behind those frameworks.\n\nFirst, he explaining the key concepts of deep learning.  Then, he live codes a neural network using Python without using any frameworks. This will help you understand the concepts at a deeper level.\n\n\ud83d\udc26 Beau Carnes on Twitter: https://twitter.com/carnesbeau\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Beau's Deep Learning course from Manning Publications: https://www.manning.com/livevideo/grokking-deep-learning-in-motion?a_aid=algmotion&a_bid=5d7bc0ba\n\nTalk given at Moscow PythonConf++ 2018.
