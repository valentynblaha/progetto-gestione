However, when you explain closures, it's worth doing a brief review of function syntax.  I think what confuses most people about closures is the return statement of the outer function, what exactly is being returned.  Most people believe the return statement is returning what is evaluated in the inner function, when, in fact, it is returning the function itself along with its lexical scope.  Note, that in the return statement, the displayName function does not have a set of parentheses following it. Remember that a function without parentheses is the function itself -- all of its syntax, instructions, lexical scope-- and NOT the value of the evaluated function, as most people might think.  In this example, when the inner function is passed to the global scope, it gets stored to a variable in much the same manner as a function expression. As with a function expression, to invoke it, you place parentheses after it to call its respective function, and it evaluates.  I've have yet to see anyone explain this in a video.  Their is an assumption that the viewer already understands this concept.  The problem with learning closures is that by the time a student gets to them, they are so used to the syntax of function declarations, that they take them for granted and probably do not realize that only the function name is used in the return statement, and not a function call.", "likes": 55}, "replies": [{"id": "UgyXHJwUptH7kGDQFqt4AaABAg.8qn9QxbX4cK9eBpzAW74t6", "publishedAt": "2022-08-01T16:39:38Z", "author": "Nwokporo Chukwuebuka", "text": "Well said.
