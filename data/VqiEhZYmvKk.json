Type system of TS is currently capable to express things that are just impossible to do in latest C#8 for example. It sounds weird, but while JS is quite dangerous without types, using VSCODE editor its even possible to code in pure JS having simply \"//ts-check\" help of typescript compiler to \"guard you\" and the VSCODE simply \"guides you\" even through syntax and semantics by quite nice error messages and hints what could be better written.... I was SHOCKED last few days, while investigating its status after few years... I am still considering GO, PYTHON3 and C#8/NETCORE3, but it will be something around those things (Go leads you better to use paralelization, but isnt saint, its ... different, doesnt like inheritance, objects too much and generics, but that must not be bad at all, as its native and FAST; python for datascience, yes, also very nice on devices, micropython/circuitpython and C# is general purpose uperset of Java, far better expresivity, even LINQ, but be carefull to target new things on portable NETCORE3 runtime...). And sure, using TypeScript, there is clean path to write multiplatform desktop/windowing apps using Electron chromium/node portable playground, of course, commandline tools possibel too. NODEJS may soon have some follower based on TS glued far more into core, so we will see...", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgyZdcvlhRD7hBj0bFV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-08-04T15:18:21Z", "author": "Ujjwal Biswas", "text": "She is great\ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugz1TVYNSERiIjp2qHV4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2019-06-21T23:19:55Z", "author": "Wendy Mueller", "text": "I have found JS boring.

It's funny that you were learning Python then moved to Javascript.   In my quest to \"figure out\" what language to learn first, I was battling between Python and Javascript also.  I decided on Python because of how easy it is.  I mean it really is simple, and that's the big selling point, along with all the different uses it has, with machine learning, data science, web development, etc.  Javascript I feel is more used in web development primarily, and no doubt, Javascript is used the most.  \n\nTo be honest, (I guess it's easy to be honest when your on the internet) it was kind of hard to concentrate on what you're actually saying.  Why? Becuase \u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 .  of how pretty you are.  It's just the reality.  Guys just look at something they're attracted to, they don't really listen.  I had to scroll the youtube video down off the screen so I could actually concentrate on what you're actually saying!  I'm not trying to be offensive at all.
