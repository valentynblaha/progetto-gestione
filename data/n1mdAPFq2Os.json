I'm working on a career transition from scientist to software engineer. I spent the last few months learning all of the parts in isolation: javascript, html, css, react, node, express, mongo, etc. While I feel like I was making great progress and able to use each part individually, I was really struggling to connect everything to bring the entire stack together into something meaningful. Then I discovered this video...\n\nThe first hour was probably the hardest part, but about 3/4 of the way through building the server, I feel like a lightbulb went off in my head. From that point on, I found myself often jumping ahead of the video and writing new features and crossing into brand new territory before watching those parts of the video. Then I would go back and watch the video to see how you solved it versus how I solved it. A few examples of many that I solved on my own were adding the create post functionality, adding authorization header to the httplink, hooking up the like button, and manually writing new posts to the query cache, and adding robust error handling on the client side for all form submissions.\n\nI feel like I'm in a dream right now, because I can't believe what I just built and the amount of progress I've made in such a short time. I'm now able to read and understand the package documentation to deploy new features. \n\nI can't thank you enough for putting this together.", "likes": 19}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugy6t8aZawkNQga6GMx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-05-22T12:01:29Z", "author": "Civilizer", "text": "Why am I getting errors on the browser window as well, and not just in the console?\nFor example:\nUnhandled Rejection (Error): Authorization header must be provided", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugys6_HZ1tE19TnWbYJ4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-05-22T10:21:04Z", "author": "Alok Kumar", "text": "In the likepost section in useEffect code\n\nlikes.find(like => like.username === user.username)\n\nIs returning undefined and cuz of that my button is not changing though every thing else is working fine , i can like/unlike the count is also increasing/decreasing .... \n\nHelp plz :)", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwIvwVJzMhVLOAxbT14AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-05-21T11:36:57Z", "author": "Galanteria", "text": "Every error it throws also reflect on screen and console both.
