The original problem did not stated the input array is sorted nor did it state how the input array is sorted. In general, you would be running your loop in ascending order and ended up working with a descending order sorted input array (or not sorted at all). The implemented pivot method would fail. Therefore, wouldn't the Big O analysis has to be O(nlogn) to account for sorting the input array first for you to know how the input array was sorted?", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "John Doe", "text": "The knapsack solution isn't really a solution.

Let (x, y) be the solution. Then it stands to reason that A = x + y, and B = x^2 + y^2.
