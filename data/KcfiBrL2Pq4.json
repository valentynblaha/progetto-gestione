This video tutorial shows you how easy is to write Javascript classes that are  readable, reusable, and refactorable.

It's maybe harder to understand or read at first, but it's not bad and it's actually THE way javascript does it, and the class keyword is, as everybody has probably read already, syntactic sugar; which is not bad at all, but, just that.\nStill, this video is wonderful! I loved the explication about composition and inheritance, really clear.\nThank you!", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxHpbOwjMltGu9HfEN4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2017-08-29T06:08:24Z", "author": "Murat Ersin", "text": "Why you use 'const' everywhere instead let?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxHpbOwjMltGu9HfEN4AaABAg.8Wq-Tg_Qs9F8Y-SFAgOHAx", "publishedAt": "2017-09-27T04:03:37Z", "author": "mulatto401", "text": "If you never update the variable (using var or let) then you should use const.
