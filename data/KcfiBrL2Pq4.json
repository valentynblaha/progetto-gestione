This video tutorial shows you how easy is to write Javascript classes that are  readable, reusable, and refactorable. This video covers ES6 classes, method chaining, and composition over inheritance.\n\nThe full Clean Code playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkK24EaPurzMq0-kw5U9pJh\n\nCode: \n\ud83d\udd17 http://codepen.io/beaucarnes/pen/OppxgZ\nRyan McDermott\u2019s original article:\n\ud83d\udd17 https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript\n\nBeau Carnes on Twitter: https://twitter.com/carnesbeau\n\n\u2b50JavaScript Playlists\u2b50\n\u25b6JavaScript Basics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbk2qRZtWSzCIN38JC_NdhW5\n\u25b6ES6: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbljtmmeS0c-CEl2LdE-eR_F\n\u25b6Design Patterns: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnZtkAI3BqcYxKnfWn_C704\n\u25b6Data Structures and Algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkso-IbgiiP48n-O-JQA9PJ\n\n-\nWe're busy people who learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits.

It's maybe harder to understand or read at first, but it's not bad and it's actually THE way javascript does it, and the class keyword is, as everybody has probably read already, syntactic sugar; which is not bad at all, but, just that.\nStill, this video is wonderful! I loved the explication about composition and inheritance, really clear.\nThank you!", "likes": 2}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Murat Ersin", "text": "Why you use 'const' everywhere instead let?", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"author": "mulatto401", "text": "If you never update the variable (using var or let) then you should use const.
