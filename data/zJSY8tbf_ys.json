(D)No one comes to the Father (E)except through Me.\r\n\r\n*Did you know you\u2019re part of the ultimate statistics, 10 out of 10 people die. One day your heart will stop beating and you will be dead! The Bible says you\u2019ll then be judged by the holy and righteous God who created this universe.(Hebrew 9:27)You\u2019ll be judged for every word, thought, and action in your life.(Matthew 12:36-37) Will you be innocent or guilty?\r\n\r\n*Let\u2019s check the standard, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever lied (even a \u201cwhite\u201d lie)? (Revelation 21:8) Have you ever stolen anything (value is irrelevant and includes downloading or copying movies illegally)?  If you\u2019ve lusted, you\u2019ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve hated someone, the Bible says you\u2019re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you\u2019ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. God is perfect and He hates sin, but He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the Cross to take the punishment you deserve. Then He rose from the graves after three days  \u2013 defeating death. (Luke 24:46-48)\r\n\r\nRepent (turn from your sins) and trust in Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour  to receive forgiveness and everlasting life afterlife here on earth without pain, suffering and death anymore (revelation 21:4) God cannot Lie He is holy, Righteous and just cannot tolerate Sin(Hebrew 6:18) if you don\u2019t believe in God you are making God a liar. Think about it.\r\n\r\nDo you think God cannot preserve His words ? He created the heaven and the earth and the sea all living things here on earth including human.\r\n\r\n. Read the Bible to learn about God and how to live. (Acts 20:21) \r\n\r\n*Do God\u2019s will, plan and purpose in your life; these are above and beyond, immeasurable compare to your grandest dream.\r\n\r\n* We obey God\u2019s moral law the Ten Commandments because we love our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, the Father and the Holy Ghost(John 14:15) (John 14:1-6) (John 14:16-26) (Mark 12:30-31)  with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength, and we believe and have faith in Him; also we Fear Him with reverence with deep respect. \r\n\r\nJob 28:28\r\nKing James Version\r\n28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10\r\nNew King James Version\r\n9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. (A)Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [a]homosexuals, nor [b]sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastes 12:13-14\r\nNew King James Version\r\n13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:\r\n\r\n(A)Fear God and keep His commandments,\r\nFor this is man\u2019s all.\r\n14 For (B)God will bring every work into judgment,\r\nIncluding every secret thing,\r\nWhether good or evil.\r\n\r\n* Let\u2019s seek the Lord and His face also His strength, power, wisdom and discernment in our daily lives.\r\n\r\nWe need God\u2019s help to overcome Sin in our lives. And live a holy life in the eyes of the Living God. \r\n\r\nGod will help us if we seek Him diligently with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength .\r\n\r\nPut on always the full armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)\r\n\r\nPhilippians 4:13\r\nNew King James Version\r\n13 I can do all things (A)through [a]Christ who strengthens me.\r\n\r\nPsalm 28:7\r\nNew King James Version\r\n7 The Lord is (A)my strength and my shield;\r\nMy heart (B)trusted in Him, and I am helped;\r\nTherefore my heart greatly rejoices,\r\nAnd with my song I will praise Him.\r\n\r\nActs 20:21\r\nKing James Version\r\n21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nGod bless.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiving water.", "likes": 1}, "replies": [{"id": "Ugxyotqpma104htU4U14AaABAg.9f8cLo13t839f98i20j_y3", "publishedAt": "2022-08-25T12:05:43Z", "author": "WhatsApp\ud83d\udc49(.+\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udfd1 \ud835\udfd1 \ud835\udfd2 \ud835\udfd2 \ud835\udfcf \ud835\udfd1 \ud835\udfd3 \ud835\udfcf \ud835\udfd4 \ud835\udfd6)", "text": "Directly \ud83d\udc46 for \ud83d\udc46 gains...", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgxAfmSoGbnhiIxJBtF4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-25T07:13:40Z", "author": "Peter", "text": "i really want a job doing this lol", "likes": 0}, "replies": [{"id": "UgxAfmSoGbnhiIxJBtF4AaABAg.9f8cHwTTnLJ9f98j4fsrL5", "publishedAt": "2022-08-25T12:05:52Z", "author": "WhatsApp\ud83d\udc49(.+\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udfd1 \ud835\udfd1 \ud835\udfd2 \ud835\udfd2 \ud835\udfcf \ud835\udfd1 \ud835\udfd3 \ud835\udfcf \ud835\udfd4 \ud835\udfd6)", "text": "Directly \ud83d\udc46 for \ud83d\udc46 gains...", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugye5IvUxe8J_bUBp-F4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2022-08-25T06:55:06Z", "author": "Ernest Sebastian", "text": "Pressing \"Enter\" in the console, inside the curly braces when writing a function, automatically finishes line execution and  goes to the next line of the editor.

John 3:17\r\n\r\nJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\r\n- John 14:6 KJV\r\n\r\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12\r\n\r\nFor if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 \r\n\r\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 \r\n\r\nAnd saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\r\n- Mark 1:15 KJV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\r\n- John 3:36 KJV\r\n\r\nWho hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 \r\n\r\nFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 \r\n\r\nThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9\r\n\r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16\r\n\r\nFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 \r\n\r\nFor scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8\r\n\r\nI am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9\r\n\r\nThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.\r\n- Romans 10:9-11 KJV\r\n\r\nFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\r\n- Romans 10:13 KJV\r\n\r\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

I usually make basic elements, add the functionality and then take my time to make it look beautiful and give a good user experience.\n\nBut that\u2019s just my opinion, everyone learn in different ways.
