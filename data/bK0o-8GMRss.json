However, with the videos way of solving the problem, \"leg\" and \"ego\" would be condensed to \"lego\" before checking to see if that connects with \"lego\" which it does leaving you only with \"lego\" as the answer, which would be wrong.

I guess we're not alone in this world.\n\nThe idea here is that, the regular expression first captures 1 or more alphanumeric characters ((\\w+)) and stores it as \"capture group #1, then it matches 1 or more whitespace characters, then it matches the capture group #1 (\\1) and the /g flag means that we want to replace all instances of this pattern (1 or more alphanumeric characters followed by any number of spaces followed by the same 1 or more alphanumeric characters of the ending of the previous word); now, the 2nd argument says that all of those instances ought to be replaced by a string that only contains the first capturing group. So for example:\n\n\"live verses\", the regexp will capture \"ve\" in \"live\" and then it will match the only space between them, then it will check to see if all of the previous things are followed by \"ve\", if that's true, it means that there's a replaceable match and then it replaces \"ve ve\" (the final match) with \"$1\" which the replace method will turn into \"ve\".", "likes": 11}, "replies": [{"id": "UgjigtJwYl3HV3gCoAEC.8UwtM8wAAZu8VLmAao1geS", "publishedAt": "2017-07-23T06:35:37Z", "author": "Jeff Lin", "text": "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token return.Don't need \"return\" here.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "UgjigtJwYl3HV3gCoAEC.8UwtM8wAAZu8V20XMUe6MT", "publishedAt": "2017-07-15T14:24:59Z", "author": "Rafa\u0142 Sobczyk", "text": "Unless you're compiling your regex inside three nested loops with thousands of iteration, you shouldn't worry about performance.
