The Messiah, as King of God's government, will undoubtedly act in this respect. \u2032\u2032 A little longer, and the wicked shall no longer be; and you shall certainly pay attention to his place, and he shall not be. But the tame selves will possess the earth, and in reality they will try exquisite delight in the abundance of peace \u2032\u2032 (Psalm 37:10, 11).\n\nWhat kind of change can we expect?\n\nGod will fully fulfill his promise to create \u2032\u2032 new heavens \", a just government that will administer a \u2032\u2032 new land \u2032\u2032 (Isaiah 65:17). The Messiah government will give blessings not only to the land of Israel, but to \u2032\u2032 all nations \", just as Jehovah promised Abraham (Isaiah 2:2, 3; Genesis 22:18). The Kingdom of God governed by the Messiah will provide a definitive and universal answer to the challenge thrown to the name and in God's purpose.\n\nWhat do you mean life then will be different from the current one?\n\nHuman race will see the long awaited fulfillment of God's promise through Isaiah: \u2032\u2032 He will certainly make judgement between the nations and make things right compared to many peoples. And they'll have to make their swords plow swords and spears to prun. Nation will not raise the sword against nation, nor will they learn the war anymore \". The prophecy continues: \u2032\u2032 They will not damage nor cause ruin throughout my holy mountain; for the earth will certainly be filled with Jehovah's knowledge as the waters cover the same sea \u2032\u2032 (Isaiah 2:4; 11:9).\n\nHow do we know this will become reality?\n\nThese promises are part of the unchanging purpose of the Almighty God, Jehovah, who is God \u2032\u2032 in the heavens above and on the earth below \u2032\u2032 (Joshua 2:11). Jehovah himself tells us: \u2032\u2032 Remember the first things of a long time ago, that I I am the Divine and there is no other God, nor any like me; He who announces the term from the beginning, and from a long time ago the things that have not been done; He who says: ' My own counsel will take effect, and I will do whatever is my delight ' \u2032\u2032 (Isaiah 46:9, 10).
