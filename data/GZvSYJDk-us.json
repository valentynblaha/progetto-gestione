Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.

In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Alphabets, Alphabets", "text": "He just taught me how to use documentation in minutes!

I recommend to actually take breaks here and there like instructed and yes indeed slow down to your speed. It breaks it down to a very beginner friendly level provided you understand things like what dictionaries, lists, JSON, etc. are and understand extreme basics networking and what a protocol is. \n\nWhen it comes down to it API's (RESTful) are just ways to utilize resources from someone else's server in this case. You already do something similar whenever you got to this site for example. You just accessed a webpage. You can just get more specific with your request by simply visiting the API pages and adjusting based off the documentation if necessary. The apps he used are pretty similar especially the Spotify site and postman. Postman actually makes it even easier to use and understand than it was in his video. \n\nJust remember the API calls when done manually just include a protocol, an API Call or request (like GET, POST, PUT, etc)  url, what you are trying to access, and credentials to do so. That's basically the just of it in this video. The rest is just making it even easier by being able to use SDK's to make the syntax even easier for workflow in your chosen language.
