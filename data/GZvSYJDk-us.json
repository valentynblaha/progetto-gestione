I went from learning 1 thing at time in big monolithic chunks that put me to sleep and had me questioning my commitment - to much smaller chunks of video not longer than 10 to 15 minutes and a much larger variety of subjects and speakers to keep me fresh - much more energy using this approach. And it doesn't worry me to on-board a subject - just work it into the daily watch list - if there are too many of them just prioritise the ones you definately want to watch or shorten the daily watch time to fit them all in.

Less would really be more. Have you ever watched that yourself? I wonder why someone thinks that with so much artificially exaggerated (aka exalted) behaviour he conveys knowledge better, that people would listen to him better and, above all, follow him better than if he looked and talked naturally and didn't gesticulate wildly and sometimes distort his mouth into the grotesque when speaking. You are far too exuberant, over-enthusiastic about what you yourself love to do. I got it, you love it. But more objectivity and naturalness in your appearance would be more beneficial to, well, to the object and not distract from it with an excessive amount of ... showmanship, not to use another term. I found it so outlandish, even cringy, that I couldn't even make it past the first minute. I couldn't watch or listen to it any longer than that.

Weirdly, they seem to be spread everywhere in the media and in commercials. I don't like using the word toxic, it's been overused now, and dishonestly so to push agendas as well; here though, I would really urge anyone thinking of making these jokes to reflect on the deprecation you are inducing to yourself, to the computer geek stereotype, and to men in general. I know it had nothing to do with ill-intent, but they project a negative narrative about men and in this case, about nerdy men. You end up doing as you wish, as you should, but I wanted to give my opinion since this is reaching so many young men and women.

I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called \u201cFischer Random Chess,\u201d where the starting position of the pieces is \u201crandomized\u201d to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where \u201cevery game\u201d has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.\r\n\r\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?\r\n\r\nI detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0\r\n\r\nBIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   \r\n\r\nThanks and God bless!\r\n \r\nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\r\nThe Ruvol Inventor", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"id": "UgwAmhMdCoO9fh6ayAR4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-01-31T03:04:26Z", "author": "Alphabets, Alphabets", "text": "He just taught me how to use documentation in minutes!

I recommend to actually take breaks here and there like instructed and yes indeed slow down to your speed. It breaks it down to a very beginner friendly level provided you understand things like what dictionaries, lists, JSON, etc. are and understand extreme basics networking and what a protocol is. \n\nWhen it comes down to it API's (RESTful) are just ways to utilize resources from someone else's server in this case. You already do something similar whenever you got to this site for example. You just accessed a webpage. You can just get more specific with your request by simply visiting the API pages and adjusting based off the documentation if necessary. The apps he used are pretty similar especially the Spotify site and postman. Postman actually makes it even easier to use and understand than it was in his video. \n\nJust remember the API calls when done manually just include a protocol, an API Call or request (like GET, POST, PUT, etc)  url, what you are trying to access, and credentials to do so. That's basically the just of it in this video. The rest is just making it even easier by being able to use SDK's to make the syntax even easier for workflow in your chosen language. If you didn't get a section of the video especially in the video just slow it down instead of rushing through.
