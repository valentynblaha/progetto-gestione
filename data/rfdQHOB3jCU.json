The key settings were set in Firebase, and I imported the google-service.json into the project, but still I get the same problem... Is it really required to perform the step 10:56 and then register the app in firebase (Android SDK -> Firebase)? Is it possible to go backward (Firebase-> Android SDK): a registered application to be developped and package using the same previous keys?
