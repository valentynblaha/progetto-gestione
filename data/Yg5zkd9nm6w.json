[2] I try follow the tutorial (Debian bullseye), I am near at the finish now. I had some troubles and one of them makes me not happy. Once I have implemented Login, sometimes when I switch between anonymous and saved user I have the added item inside the cart, but this item has Product == null. When I run debugger before and after the adding command, the proper Product is still included. Nothing appears in Django console, in Vue console, in Javascript console. Seems that restart will repair it, but forever? for some time? I have some theories about it: 1) Should the `cart` variable be it each component? is this not a risk? Couldn't we have single variable in vuex store only? and the same with functions which sum items count or total price - such duplicate code could be removed; 2) some troubles with corrupted LocalStorage?; 3) Is this not an internal bug in Vue reactivity? -- Number (3) is a worsest one. Can I really believe that JavaScript+Vue are mature enough? I just want to do things better and easier as in plain Django. But I'm unsure now again.
