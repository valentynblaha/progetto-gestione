Both Python and C# are interpreted languages. \nIt's because Python is *dynamically typed* . That means a variable can change its data type later on.\nIn C#, you cannot do:\nbool doIt = false;\ndoIt = \"hello\";\nBecause once a variable has been assigned a data type, you can't change it to a different data type (it's statically typed). So, the initial data type of the variable is significant and needs to be mentioned (technically not necessary, even C# can infer the data type of a variable from the right hand side (you can use _auto_ instead of _bool_ , but it's a convention to do so).\nIn Python, it's perfectly okay to do this:\ndoIt = False\ndoIt = \"hello\"\nas the data type of a variable is flexible, the initial data type doesn't hold any significance and so need not be mentioned (though you can still mention it if you like:\ndoIt: bool = False\ndoIt = \"Hello\"\nMentioning it doesn't constraint the variable to that data type.)", "likes": 11}, "replies": [{"author": "TheLittleMike", "text": "I know this is 6 months old, but I'm going through the video and noticed the same things. To expand a little on what you said:\n\nJabrils incorrectly uses the term casting. Funny, because it's specifically related to your comment. You *can* change a variable data type in some instances in c#. For example, to change a string to a bool, you use the ToBoolean() method to... wait for it... CAST a string to a bool. Casting means changing the variable data type. What he uses the term for is \"declaring\" the variable. Part of the variable declaration is the data type (and name).\n\nSo yeah, great video with a few caveats.
