She rushes through higher order functions and advanced array techniques like it's obvious subjects when these are often the last chapters of beginner programming books and courses.

Also, the command prompt is NOT case sensitive!\r\nUse \"dir\" to pull up the directory. *Note that you may want to clear up your desktop for this to run smoother\r\nTo add html, js, and css: Use \"fsutil file create new index.html 0\" \"fsutil file create new style.css 0\" \"fsutil file create new app.js 0\" \r\nUse \"move\" to move these files from the desktop to your basic-tetris folder\r\n**To check if you've successfully moved the files, pull up the directory \"dir\" and view the \"basic-tetris\" DIR (or folder)\r\nAfter atom is downloaded use \"atom\" to run it from the command panel-- no \".\" is necessary\n**Note: Every time Ania types \"atom.\" that makes you must close you current atom window FIRST, THEN run it again\r\n\r\nRUNNING ATOM FOR THE FIRST TIME: Agree to everything! And click \"Yes\" When a message pops up saying \" would you like to download the dependencies of this package\"\r\n\r\nPACKAGES: in atom, install them manually in settings. to get there: File>Settings>Install\r\n - Copy/paste the following *They are slightly different than the package Ania used\r\n - - auto-indent\r\n - - atom-ternjs\r\n - - atom-file-icons\r\n - - language-ejs\r\n - - language-babel\r\n - - linter\r\n - - linter-erb\r\n - - linter-csslint\r\n - - linter-eslint\r\n - - linter-js-yaml\r\n\r\nUse \"apm install\" in the command prompt to install the packages.

I Unstalled the linter-js-standard package and reinstalled it on the command prompt, then relaunched atom to resolve that error\r\nTo Open browser: \nI did not have this command. Instead, download the \"script\" package on atom. Then click your HTML CODE *Make sure you click the CODE itself. \r\nAfter script is installed, you can open the browser, here's how CLICK: Packages>Script>Run Script\r\nFor me, Internet Explorer was prompted, once you click it you'll see your code.\r\n**Note: if you don't see the following, your code is wrong and you need to find the errors!:\r\n - The tab should be called \"Basic Tetris\"\r\n - You should see and \"Start/Pause\" button\r\n - You should see \"Score:0\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't have any more technical difficulties once you start coding.
