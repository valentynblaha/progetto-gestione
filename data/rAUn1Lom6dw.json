You should learn Javascript from a course only dedicated for JS and then you should watch these type of tutorials just to review your concepts and learn how the things are applied to make a functional project. This is an application of the concepts of JS. You should follow and learn how she is making and thinking up things to make the game and that reason fails when you just code along it her.

When you explained that array structures for lTetromino, zTetromino, tTetromino, oTetromino, iTetromino with visualizing using Google Sheet that was nice to grasp. Actually everything we need to visualize first to fully gather the concept, then we can build our own game using our programming logic. Thanks for this tutorial.
