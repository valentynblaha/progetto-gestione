This equates to 7.2 million businesses.\n- If each of these businesses paid $3,000 for a website then that would be a total market of $21,600,000 (7.2m * $3,000).\n\nHow you can stand out from other freelancers. \n- It\u2019s important to recognize that most developers don\u2019t do a good job of connecting with potential customers.\n- There are a plenty of web developers in the US. Despite this, 7.2 million small businesses don\u2019t have a website. \n- The fact that there is a high number of developers and a high number of businesses still in need of service indicates a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the development community and the small business community.\n- The best way to bridge the \u201cdisconnect\u201d is to identify and solve the problems of small businesses.\n- Developers must talk to small businesses about their problems and how software will solve those problems.\n- Many developers make the mistake of talking about software and code and not about problem solving.\n- Taking a \u201cproblem solver\u201d approach will help bridge the disconnect between developers and small businesses.\n\nHow to sell your services.\n- The initial meeting/phone call is your opportunity to connect with the customer.\n- Use your initial meeting with a potential customer to identify the customer\u2019s needs and problems.\n- Identifying the potential customer\u2019s problems requires in-depth questions and follow up.\n- Close the sale by explaining how software will solve the problems you have identified.\n- Give specifics as to functions the software will perform and how those functions will solve the problems you have identified. This is more effective than the approach of many other developers\n- Your written proposal must be specific as to the services you are providing. This avoids disputes.\n\nWhere to sell your services\n- Networking events can help generate business.\n- DO NOT go to networking events which are mostly made up of developers. It\u2019s better if you\u2019re the only developer in the room.\n- BNI (https://www.bni.com/) is a good place to network with small business owners.\n- Third party services can help you find customers\n- Thumbtack.com and Fiverr.com are good places to find customers.\n- Third party services/platforms often include fees for listing your services and you will often perform work for reduced rates.\n- Your own website can bring in business.\n- This doesn\u2019t require the time of networking and alleviates the problems of third-party services/platforms\n- Google Adwords is a way to promote your website. Adwords, however can be expensive.\n\nFollow Luke on Twitter: https://twitter.com/luke_ciciliano\n\nCheck out Luke's website, SEO For Lawyers: https://www.seo-for-lawyers.com/\n\n-\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com", "duration": "PT35M17S", "likes": "2665", "views": "68794"}, "comments": [{"topLevelComment": {"id": "Ugzx5l7nfzJK2n0lPOx4AaABAg", "publishedAt": "2021-12-21T18:04:36Z", "author": "Ztq", "text": "Thanks for the video.

The stuff that you really can't find in books or videos.\n\n1) If a client asks me to build a site that I think is atrocious (blinking robots on a black background 'cause he thinks it's cool).  It's his web site after all and I need the money.  Should I build it for him?\n\n2) Who should own the source code for the web site I built for a client?  Can the customer give the web site I built for him to his brother who has  a similar business?  Or resell the site to other businesses in the same sector?\n\n3) Cold calling (on the phone) to drum up business is something I hate and I don't think is very efficient anyway.  Are e-mail campaigns just as bad?\n\n4) Who should write the \"copy\" of the web site?  Some businesses don't know what a tag line is or even have a logo.  They don't have any idea what the web site should say.  All they want is to increase their sales.  What is the best way of creating the text for a web site?  Who should provide the images for the site?\n\n5) Should maintenance time be included in the contract or should it be a separate contract for that?\n\n6) Should developers get a \"white label\" hosting site so we can sell hosting space and domain registration to our clients?  Is this upsell  income worth it?\n\n7) What systems do you use, as a successful developer, to keep track of clients, billing, invoice generation, online payment sites (Paypal)?  Is WHMcs worth the subscription?\n\n8) If the sites we build for our clients are supposed to increase their business, are we more of a marketing firm?  Do we need to conduct marketing test on their logo (if we are asked to create one) or their tag line?  Do we need to understand their target audience and create the copy accordingly?  Or are we just creating an electronic  \"brochure\"?  At times I feel we need to have both marketing and web design skills to solve the clients problem and at times I just want to create the site and not worry about the other.  Do you do everything in your business for your clients: marketing analysis, UX and UI design, requirements analysis,  accounting, Wordpress development, etc.?\n\nSome of these topics may not require a whole video tutorial but are just some of the topics that come to mind. \n\nLooking forward to more of your videos.\n\nThanks!

Couple of things to note on BNI though. Firstly DO NOT rely on it for 100% of your business, I've seen people make that mistake and eventually they stop being able to give back to their Chapter.
