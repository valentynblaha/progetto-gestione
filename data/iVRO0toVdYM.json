Hooks should just about replace most use cases for hocs. Also you don't really need to delve deep into javascript classes even without hooks. All you ever use with classes in react are the lifecycle methods and custom methods. Since React uses composition instead of inheritance and every method is private, you don't really need to have any OOP knowledge either.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Waleed Iqbal", "text": "9:27 you could have just wriitten \"import Playlist from './Playlist'\"; instead of \"import Playlist from '../containers/Playlist'\";", "likes": 3}, "replies": [{"author": "Waleed Iqbal", "text": "@Weibenfalk Its totally understandable.
