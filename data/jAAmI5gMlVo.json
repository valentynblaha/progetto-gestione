{"video": {"id": "jAAmI5gMlVo", "title": "Async/Await - JavaScript Tutorial", "description": "This is an in-depth look at the Async/Await feature in JavaScript.\n\nCode: https://github.com/eXtremeXR/Async-Await\n\nFirst, we're going to go through brief history of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and see how it transitioned from callbacks to promises to generators and to finally Async/Await.\n\nThen we're going to focus purely on Async/Await and we'll go through a bunch of examples.\n\nWe'll start off by learning how we can do sequential flow using Async/Await and we'll also see how we need to be careful about error handling.\n\nNext, we'll move onto parallel execution. We'll see how we can use Promise.all() function to be able to execute multiple promises in parallel. Again, we'll see why we need to be careful about our error handling.\n\nLast but not least, we'll take a look at how we can do iterations with Async/Await. We'll start off with for loop, then move onto forEach, for of loop is going to be next and finally we'll wrap that section with while loop.\n\nAt the end, we'll do a quick recap of the things we just went through.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fContents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f 0:00 - Introduction\n\u2328\ufe0f 1:28 - Callbacks Example\n\u2328\ufe0f 6:44 - Promises Example\n\u2328\ufe0f 9:40 - Async/Await Example\n\u2328\ufe0f 13:18 - Coding Examples Begin\n\u2328\ufe0f 14:09 - Sequential Example (Naive)\n\u2328\ufe0f 19:27 - Sequential Example (Issue)\n\u2328\ufe0f 21:18 - Sequential Example (Solution)\n\u2328\ufe0f 23:48 - Parallel Example (Naive)\n\u2328\ufe0f 27:21 - Parallel Example (Issue)\n\u2328\ufe0f 28:58 - Parallel Example (Solution)\n\u2328\ufe0f 31:55 - For Loop Example \n\u2328\ufe0f 36:49 - ForEach Example\n\u2328\ufe0f 40:06 - For-Of Example\n\u2328\ufe0f 42:06 - While Loop Example\n\u2328\ufe0f 44:03 - Recap\n\nTutorial from CodeWorkr.
