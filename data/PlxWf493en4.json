For example, I decided to do an experiment where I moved some nested div boxes around in a way where the boxes partially overlapped along with some text that was placed inside of each box. When I placed a div box with text that would normally be where the div boxes overlapped, that is where I found somewhat logic take place. When deciding where each div class needed to go, the placement in your code matters. The box that would normally have to be placed in the background of the other box was placed on top when listed first in the code. Therefore the text from the box that was supposed to be added first was also covered up. As obvious as this would seem, it still shows a form of logic where I would call it sequential logic compared to the logic actual programming languages use where the particular code is running the logic that was entered by the user to run the task by itself.", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Asian Lady \ud83c\udf3a", "text": "Thank you Mrs!

Even if SS offers great templates, sometimes creating your own to meet the custom needs of the clients will be more preferable. \r\n\r\nBig corporations like Amazon, McDonald's, Netflix, Walmart, etc. likely don't use website builders because they likely require everything from scratch from the front-end to the back-end like databases. For a small business or a ma and pa store, you could use templates. It all depends on your clients' needs. \r\n\r\nAlso, it's pretty cool and fulfilling to have the skills to build a website by hand.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\tIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\t\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\tThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.<br><br><br><br><br>\r\n\t\t <b>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum</b><br>\t\r\n\t\t , <i>\tyou need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing</i> <u>\thidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on </u><em>\t\tthe Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,</em><strong>\tcombined with a handful of model sentence structures, </strong>\r\n\t\t <hr> \r\n\t\tto generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated <a href=\"https://www.lipsum.com/\"target=\"_black\"> Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</a></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<img src=\"download.jfif\" border=\"10\">\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>apples\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Golden delicious</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Granny smith</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Gala</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>oranges</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>pineapples</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>mangoes</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>drangonfruit</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t<table border=\"10\"cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"> \r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Month</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Rent</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"2\">Utilities</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Groceries</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Eating Out</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Entertainment</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td rowspan=\"3\">Fall</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>June</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$1500</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$50</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$350</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$50</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>July</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$1500</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$50</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$350</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$50</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>August</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$1500</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$50</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$350</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$50</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n\t</body>\r\n\t</html>", "likes": 1}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Fati Harmin", "text": "Watching this on my lunch break because I need to create a simple page for a class.

The <img> tag's border attribute is deprecated sincs HTML 4.01 (almost 20 years now) and obsolete since HTML5.  So it really *does not exist*. Those who learn HTML nowadays should not know about these attributes at all, let alone use it anywhere in their web pages. Either show the proper, valid way to put a border around an image (I understand you didn't want to get into CSS in this video), or don't show it at all.\n\nSimilarly, in HTML5 <table> doesn't have border, cellpadding and cellspacing attributes.
