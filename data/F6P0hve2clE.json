But it's just disrespectful to other people you speak with and listeners when you don't make any effort to sound as native speaker as possible. Some people just refuse to understand that other languages have different sounds even if they may be written down alike. So Russians usually don\u2019t learn the \u201cr\u201d, \u201cd\u201d, \u201ct\u201d, \u201cth\u201d sounds and just replace it with the russian  \u0440, \u0434, \u0442, and \u0441 sounds.

Some languages are just harder or easier to pronounce for people from some other languages. \n\nFor example, I'm Bengali and while I've been writing in English for many, many years, I've never really put any effort into sounding like a native speaker. Or more accurately, I don't have the fabled American accent that everyone wants to hear. And yet, every single native speaker that I've talked to in my life effortlessly understood me. This is simply because Bengalis don't have that strong of an accent (in English).\n\nThat said, I personally consider it disrespectful to ask people to abandon their accents when what they're saying is easily understood. Accents can vary region to region, person to person, even amongst native speakers themselves. So my suggestion for you is, if you ever find yourself pissed off at someone's accent even though you understand them clearly, stop and contemplate if it's the accent that's annoying to you or the simple fact that different people exist. I'm sure you'll learn your lesson at some point if you think hard enough.", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Dishan Sachin", "text": "Btw He did a great job \ud83d\udc4d", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Phat", "text": "@hamza abdirizak It\u2019s not about understanding at all.
