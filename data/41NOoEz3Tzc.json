( QUESTION )  If a person BUYS a Product when they press SUBMIT PAYMENT their product is not automatically sent until payment is confirmed I should think this would be the same basic function right ???", "likes": 0}, {"author": "Craig Dennis", "text": "Hi there! I totally see your frustration and we've all been there! I think you're looking for something like Stripe checkout https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout\n\nThis is a flow where once completed you will get confirmation of payment at your site in the form of a payment token. You don't want to really store the payment information, you just want to know you got paid. You store the token that you can use either in Stripe's console or via their API.\n\nWhen you set this up you provide a URL to go to on success. Stripe will submit information back to you via a form post. In a way this is very similar to a webhooks it is just flow based and synchronous.\n\nHope that helps!", "likes": 1}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "That Guy", "text": "Using postman to turn on lightbulbs, I'm in!", "likes": 11}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Y S", "text": "1:04:00 the message is sent twice, idk why XD", "likes": 0}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Audrey Zindler", "text": "I'm so glad this is live! :D", "likes": 2}, "replies": [{"author": "Craig Dennis", "text": "Your work is gorgeous Audrey!", "likes": 0}]}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Y S", "text": "I wish a dark mode for the video \ud83d\ude06", "likes": 3}}, {"topLevelComment": {"author": "Boris", "text": "Wait, I was re-watching your API course and reading Twilio documentation, stumbled upon Webhooks article, opened youtube to... find this in my recommendations on my first page?
