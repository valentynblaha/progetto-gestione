Then I'd rather use it on the package.json just so you can insure that anyone else that wants to debug or check your code would have the same enviropment you got. It also helps with code consistency. As using it on vscode though, keep in mind that (as far as I know) you'll still need a .eslintrc file on a project level, so it isn't that much of a deal anyway.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugx0wrWoCznKEa2L-H14AaABAg.8f97DomqhqO8fSu-z8ZxHA", "publishedAt": "2018-04-25T10:44:05Z", "author": "Kai Xu", "text": "Similar question here: is there any advantage to use the eslint plugin in vscode rather than a node package, if 1) you always use vscdoe as the ide 2) for personal project only?", "likes": 0}, {"id": "Ugx0wrWoCznKEa2L-H14AaABAg.8f97DomqhqO8f99erikAbg", "publishedAt": "2018-04-17T18:44:48Z", "author": "Regular", "text": "Thats where I am atm, I just installed it globally but I still have to point to it in a project level as you said. While I understand that its better to have as a dev dependency in a common project, theres a lot of projects I only do for practice and they are pretty damn small, most of the times I don't even have repos for them. But still, I wanted to have eslinting on these cases as well. I thought it would be possible to have a global .eslintrc file and as I had a more specific .eslintrc on the project tree it would just simply override the global one. But oh well, I think thats just not possible then.
